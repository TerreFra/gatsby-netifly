I knew we&#8217;d have finished this quickly if we got help only by those huge guys!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The man was delighted by the efficiency of the monster.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Are my subordinates useful?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Yeah. They still have a lot to learn, but they&#8217;re working properly!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Essentially, some of the minotaurs became the carpenters&#8217; pupils. Given their inhuman strength and muscular bodies, they mainly had to transport the huge lumbers that men couldn&#8217;t move.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Now that they&#8217;re working on the fence, my men can focus on helping each other.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Since he could lower the number of people working on the fence, the other jobs were proceeding faster.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Seems like there will be more monsters than usual this year, but thanks to your subordinates we can prepare accordingly!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I&#8217;m glad to hear that.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">There was no shortage of tasks for Raiz and his comrades until the monsters tried to raid the city. They had to repair the city walls, protect the construction of the fence, create pits to hindrance the attackers&#8217; advance, and produce preserved food.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Also&#8230;</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Oh, right, the prototype model you asked for is almost complete. If nothing happens, we will be able to produce it in mass.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">They had to prepare for a face-off with the monsters.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">We got a lot of ideas from you guys, so everything should proceed smoother than last year!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz looked at the cackling carpenter while thinking about the discussion he had the day before with the Guild Master.</span></p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\">◆</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">You see, maybe I know the reason why there are more monsters this year.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">After they finished their talk, Trow suddenly brought that topic up.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Oh, did you figure something out?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Yeah, the key is something that was here until last year.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Something that was here until last year?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Let’s try to say it like this&#8230; Last year we didn&#8217;t have something we now have.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Lety cocked her head. She didn’t understand his riddle.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">E-Err&#8230; a ranch to keep animals in?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">No. It&#8217;s something abstract, not tangible.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Trow placed his finger on the edge of the map.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Peace. The war ended last year.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Eh? Why should it be connected with the increase of the monsters’ population?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Lety didn&#8217;t take the hint in the slightest, but Raiz didn’t miss what Trow meant.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I see! The corpses!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Exactly. People died in the front line and rear line as well. Sometimes, someone died while intercepting an enemy force that infiltrated in the country, sometimes someone died in secret battles, and sometimes a spy moved the wrong way and became food for monsters.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">All those corpses were easy food for monsters, right?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Monsters usually attacked humans, but their reason was mainly searching for food.<br />\n</span>Raiz knew that very well.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Right. Monsters could easily find food on battlefields, but now it became impossible, so they will try to search for another source of food. Actually, I tried to ask this city&#8217;s veterans, and they said that in their grandparents&#8217; days, Dekuch faced many crises&#8230; but once the war started, the attacks subsided.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The presents fell silent. Brooding over those words, complex feelings mixed in their hearts.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">They fought to end the war for the sake of people, but they couldn&#8217;t help but feel bad now that it caused a disaster in a part of the country.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Well, keep fighting might have destroyed Tend, so you did the right thing.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Trow encouraged the other two, whose faces were gloomy. He really was a mature, composed adult.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">&#8230;Yeah, you&#8217;re right. We just have to win this battle to prove that ending the war wasn&#8217;t an error.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Indeed. I&#8217;m really sorry about this, but we can&#8217;t ask help to the knights. It will just take too much time until they receive our request and dispatch a force that will reach us. They could&#8217;ve at least sent here some subordinates, though&#8230;”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Oh well, we shall handle this with our current resources, then. Having a super-knight with plenty of combat experience will be more than enough.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I&#8217;ll do my best!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Lety&#8217;s gloomy expression brightened at his words.</p>\n<p align=\"CENTER\">◆</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Three days went by.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Lord Raaaiz~!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Harpy, who was patrolling the forest, landed in front of the tamer.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">What happened?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">A lot of monsters left the forest~!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Hearing Harpy’s report, the nearby people started panicking a little.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">How many are them? How much time do we have before they reach us?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Uhm&#8230; They&#8217;re a lot! The forest went all roar and stuff! The faster ones will take a day or something, and the slower ones maybe two or three days.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Are flying monsters among them?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Not many, I think.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Is the entire forest moving or only a part of it?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Only a part.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Are they coming from multiple directions?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Yep, many!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\"><i>So, a part of the forest couldn&#8217;t keep them anymore&#8230; Let&#8217;s guess several hundred will come this way. Their real number will depend on their path:ì, though. Will they split and head toward other cities or will we have to handle their entire force by ourselves?</i></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Harpy, sorry, but could you go see if they are all coming here?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Okaaay~! Leave it to me!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The next moment, she jumped and started to fly back toward the forest.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">We don&#8217;t have much time left.”</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter24/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/monstersguild/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter26/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1691\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"7ac2de82af\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1691\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">3+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"Monsters&#8217; Guild &#8211; Chapter 25","featured_media":{"id":"0d92c2f4-93f0-5f5c-96b4-1f4f6b5bd939","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/monsters-guild-banner-1.png"},"categories":[{"id":"30e10852-d86d-5f1d-b35d-f45bf02d53e9","name":"Welcome to the Monsters Guild!"}],"excerpt":"<p>Prepare for battle “Great, leave it there!” “Yes!” A minotaur [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"monstersguild-chapter25"}}}
