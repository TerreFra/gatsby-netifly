Tell me sincerely.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve said it many times, Elsa. It was just a party with all the slums&#8217; inhabitants. I also think we were a little too loud, but I&#8217;ve already apologized for that, haven&#8217;t I?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that was ‘a little’ for you?! Fool!”</p>\n<p>Her tied hair swung as she slammed her fist on the desk.</p>\n<p>“We could hear your screams from this very station, and to reach you, the cause of that tumult, I had to push my way through a crowd of drunkards! Do you know how hard it was?! None of them listened to me, and I couldn&#8217;t understand a single word they were saying!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, I see. I didn&#8217;t know about that, but I&#8217;m still the culprit, so it doesn&#8217;t matter.”</p>\n<p>“Are you not regretting your action? You aren&#8217;t, are you?! Is that it?!”</p>\n<p>“Well, the slums are always noisy. If you&#8217;re that neurotic, you&#8217;ll ruin your skin.”</p>\n<p>“Mh&#8230;? You&#8217;re so considerate, Soft-hearted slave merchant, but I&#8217;m a guard and also a knight. Do you understand that treating me like a woman insults me?”</p>\n<p>“Nonsense. I&#8217;d never try to insult the daughter of the Fairstadt family.”</p>\n<p>“Then what was the point of your words?”</p>\n<p>“You&#8217;re fun when you&#8217;re angry, so I wanted to tease you a bit more.”</p>\n<p>“That! Is! It! You wanted to insult me!”</p>\n<p>As her face flushed red from anger, she kept hitting the desk over and over again.<br />\nThat was exactly the fun reaction he wanted to see, but she didn&#8217;t seem to be aware of it.</p>\n<p>“Yesterday you even told me that you didn’t have the time or the intention to cause troubles! Remember?!”</p>\n<p>“I said ‘tonight’, didn&#8217;t I? Meaning that today, which is the day after the Harvest Festival, I could cause all kind of troubles.”</p>\n<p>“Just don&#8217;t do that! That’s why people like you are&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, c&#8217;mon, calm down, Captain of the Guards. I didn&#8217;t let you drag me here only to tease you.”</p>\n<p>“Tch&#8230; Okay, fine. This isn&#8217;t the first time you’ve done something like this, and it won’t be the last. If you really did it as a celebration, there&#8217;s no need to dig any further into the matter.”</p>\n<p>“Wow, you&#8217;re super honest today. Let&#8217;s be friendlier with each other, &#8216;kay?”</p>\n<p>“Listen, can you please realize that I don&#8217;t want to be your friend&#8230;?”</p>\n<p>The knight&#8217;s anger disappeared, leaving her pleading with a tearful voice.<br />\nThe commotion of the festival and her daily work must have worn her out considerably.</p>\n<p>“I&#8217;m trying my best as a knight, but people are envious since I&#8217;m a woman. I tried to keep an eye on Mirta because I&#8217;m worried sick, and ended up accepting the slums&#8217; Captain of the Guards&#8217; role that no one wants, and now here I am, talking with the embodiment of exasperation itself&#8230;”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, whatever, can I go home now? I don&#8217;t wanna listen to your sermon.”</p>\n<p>“If you keep this up, I will hit you.”</p>\n<p>“But you still haven&#8217;t. I&#8217;m deeply moved by your kindness.”</p>\n<p>“You&#8217;re always like that. I can&#8217;t just ask my subordinates to handle you, so I have to take this responsibility myself&#8230; the last guy who tried, resigned and returned home.”</p>\n<p>“Well, Listina is a big city. It&#8217;s normal for someone from the countryside to be overwhelmed.”</p>\n<p>“I bet you did something, didn&#8217;t you?! Oh well, he was being too friendly and randomly touched me. Also, he looked at me in a strange way, so I&#8217;m more at ease now that he has left.”</p>\n<p>“That&#8217;s great. If a guard were to make a scandal, even your dignity would have been tainted. You were lucky that he went away before he could try to lay his filthy hands on you.”</p>\n<p>Takumi started to whistle shamelessly, and Elsa clenched her fist as she tried to hold her anger down. In the end, she sighed deeply, as if surrendering to resignation.</p>\n<p>“So? Every time you let me catch you this easily, something bad is going to happen.<br />\nWhat is it this time?”</p>\n<p>“Nice guess, that saves me some time. I let you arrest me because I didn&#8217;t want people to see us talking in public, even if you might think it wasn&#8217;t necessary.”</p>\n<p>“Just spit it out. I’m listening.”</p>\n<p>“Well&#8230; you should have already heard about this.”</p>\n<p>She looked at him puzzled.</p>\n<p>“Recently, illegal gambles are spreading in the slums.”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;How do you know about that?”</p>\n<p>“Do you really want to know that now?”</p>\n<p>“Well, no, but realizing it, it hurts&#8230;”</p>\n<p>Her face stiffened, and she let out the deepest sigh of her day.</p>\n<p>“Sorry, Takumi, but I won&#8217;t tell you anything about that. Even though I&#8217;m looking for information, I won&#8217;t exchange any for money.”</p>\n<p>“Of course, I can&#8217;t buy information from the Captain of the Guards with money. Also&#8230; you don&#8217;t have any, right?”</p>\n<p>Takumi smiled faintly as he noticed her reaction.</p>\n<p>“Rumors about them are spreading. You know that they are hosted in the slums and that the average customers are nobles with lots of free-time, but you don&#8217;t know who is behind this, so you don&#8217;t really have a lead&#8230; am I right?”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;To be accurate, the guards deployed in the slums don&#8217;t have enough power to keep investigating by themselves, so they gave up&#8230; As knights, I wonder where their pride and dignity went.”</p>\n<p>“Those thoughts stem from your family’s teachings. A common person wouldn&#8217;t think of opposing evil and risking his life despite its family and rank.”</p>\n<p>Elsa was part of the Fairstadt family, one of the three major families in Listina. They had a long and honorable tradition and have been taking care of judicial and royal affairs for generations.<br />\nThey had a strong sense of justice, and were like the embodiment of fairness, so it was normal that the guards were a little intimidated by one of its members.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;I read records about those illegal gamblings. Enjoying slaves fighting each other to death isn&#8217;t humane.”</p>\n<p>Her fist started to tremble while she imagined that.<br />\nTakumi smiled at her.</p>\n<p>“Hey Elsa, they shouldn&#8217;t get away with this, don&#8217;t you think?”</p>\n<p>“Of course! As a proud knight of Richtert, I can&#8217;t allow such inhuman acts to be performed!”</p>\n<p>“You&#8217;re not alone, your subordinates think the same. They always have to deal with scum, but they&#8217;re not intoxicated by their power like the upper part&#8217;s guards, right?”</p>\n<p>“Exactly! They can suppress you guys when needed and never miss a day of training!”</p>\n<p>“Then can we tag along and crush those criminals?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, we should punish those evildoers! Wait, what?”</p>\n<p>Takumi wore a toothy smile while looking at her gaping mouth.</p>\n<p>“Come with me, I&#8217;ll tell you the details at Valeria&#8217;s.”</p>\n<p>“Eh? No&#8230; are you serious?”</p>\n<p>“Of course. Those guys bothered our leader too, so I wanted to draw a clear line between us and them.”</p>\n<p>“N-No, wait a minute. Do you even know who are we going to crush? If there&#8217;s someone important involved, the nobles won&#8217;t remain silent.”</p>\n<p>“Where did you put the knight&#8217;s pride you were talking about a few minutes ago?”</p>\n<p>“I-It&#8217;s still here, I’m not hesitating! I want to arrest them with my own hands, if I can, but&#8230; I don&#8217;t have enough information. Nobles and clerics are privileged in the slums. They can be visited only by a few people and only in private places, so even if we start a public investigation, they&#8217;d destroy all the evidence as soon as they notice that something&#8217;s going on.”</p>\n<p>Frowning her brows, she let out another sigh. Elsa lived in the slums, so she knew very well how things worked there.<br />\nLooking at the disheartened girl, Takumi opened his blasphemous mouth.</p>\n<p>“The illegal gambles are set up by Amberg, one of the four major companies, and its affiliated organizations. They use several places, like the company&#8217;s buildings or secondary residences offered by investors. The next event will be held in the basement of one of Marquis of Kelbeg&#8217;s houses two weeks from now.”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Eh?”</p>\n<p>Unable of processing all that information, she could only reply in a dumb voice.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, you&#8217;re welcome, Elsa. I can even tell you how much of their private forces will be deployed. If you really want to capture them and you&#8217;re not like those cowards of the slums, we can do this.”</p>\n<p>He smiled with confidence.</p>\n<p>“Your answer? Don&#8217;t just wave your justice around, this chance will bring the guards a lot of merits. Taking this opportunity is up to you.”</p>\n<p>He admired her dumbfounded face for a few instants, then started speaking again.</p>\n<p>“Oh, and don&#8217;t ask me how do I know all of that, please.”</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/newgame-chapter13/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/newgame/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/newgame-chapter15/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1290\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"06a3879827\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1290\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">3+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"New Game &#8211; Chapter 14","featured_media":{"id":"f7196a99-3aa6-576c-bfdc-d3a4aafea738","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/newgame-banner.png"},"categories":[{"id":"711623f2-28a0-57e3-9ad6-85a46264a357","name":"A New Game from the Depths of Captivity!"}],"excerpt":"<p>Major companies – Part 3 When the new festival came [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-chapter14"}}}
