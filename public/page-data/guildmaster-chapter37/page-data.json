She could provide me with some information about the merchants.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I do know something spicy, but treating me to something good will loosen my tongue. Deal, buddy?”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Wait, are you already drunk? What happened? C&#8217;mon, tell me about it.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">It&#8217;s nooothing! I only happened to find a cute guy in the intelligence depaaartment, but he said he&#8217;s not interested in giiirls and didn&#8217;t give me his addreeess! Damn my three handicaps! I know I&#8217;m a bottomless bit with no sex appeal and flat as a board!”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">I didn&#8217;t find her that bad, honestly, but given that she was into good-looking guys, they all probably searched very ideal characteristics for a girl.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Actually, they probably didn&#8217;t want to mix work and love, as the latter could be found in other places. Even I and Cody, although I believed her to be a man in the past, never approached each other thoughtlessly despite our friendship.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I&#8217;ll have something too. Don&#8217;t mix drinks up, though. It&#8217;s not a wise choice.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Yeah, I know, but why is that?! Tell me, buddyyy!”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">It&#8217;s a matter of taste. A drinker should know that mixing alcohol will numb their tongue in no time. It makes you get drunk easier too. That&#8217;s the only way for me to get drunk.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Whaaat? Is that so? I&#8217;ll watch out then, but it&#8217;s too late for me now.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">We also have drinks that help you overcome the numbness. Master, a refreshing lemonade,<i> </i>please.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">It was spring water blended with lemon juice and enhanced with Healing Magic, a great drink to recover. There was barely any sugar, so many guests ordered it before leaving in order to avoid being sluggish at work the next day. Since it worked very well and cost only eight copper coins, they usually came to drink here again.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">After seeing it, even Cody, who looked dizzy, kept ordering the same drink without mixing it with any other. I could have purified her liver if she let me, but I doubt she would have granted me a chance like that so easily.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Now that I thought about it, I started to be conscious of her. It&#8217;s said that friendship can&#8217;t bloom in a relationship between opposite sexes, but I just couldn&#8217;t accept this line traced by who knows who.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Mmmh&#8230;! Tastes good. I did not know this could be served as the last drink.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Pretty boy, have you never had it before?”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Hahaha&#8230; Saying I did would sound <span lang=\"it-IT\">presumptuous</span> of me. Anyhow, you have some<span lang=\"it-IT\">thing</span> i<span lang=\"it-IT\">nteresting </span>to tell me, <span lang=\"it-IT\">right</span>?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Cody was making things easier for me, although I literally spent my day drinking&#8230; but I was still good so who <span lang=\"it-IT\">cared about me.</span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">If she was a man, seeing him overly helpful wouldn&#8217;t have bothered me, but when I thought that he was a girl, somehow it didn&#8217;t feel the same&#8230; I ended up thinking about it so often I <span lang=\"it-IT\">was starting to feel guilty</span>.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Well, the merchants <span lang=\"it-IT\">should&#8217;ve</span> bought their beasts from someone in the capital, right? But uncontrolled beasts might spread disease and stuff, so <span lang=\"it-IT\">only</span> controlled ones <span lang=\"it-IT\">should be kept</span>.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Mylarka&#8217;s fairy bird had been registered and controlled when <span lang=\"it-IT\">she received it</span>, and even the fire dragon that we rode together had been checked by Shura, who <span lang=\"it-IT\">said it was in good shape</span>.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Now, keeping beasts is really expensive, so beast traders profit from their job <span lang=\"it-IT\">only</span> by selling <span lang=\"it-IT\">specific </span>animals to nobles. I mean, dogs, <span lang=\"it-IT\">wild wolves</span>, kitties&#8230; there&#8217;s a low demand for them, so beast traders must capture rare animal<span lang=\"it-IT\">s</span> to keep their business alive.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">That way it feels closer to selling a treasure, right?”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Right, <span lang=\"it-IT\">exactly</span>. Then it becomes a race and quarrels start to become <span lang=\"it-IT\">daily routine </span>between them. I heard that a certain company called ‘Garamdoor’ found a way to grow really fast, but I don&#8217;t trust some of those rumors&#8230;”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Thanks to the last report I heard about Garamdoor, I was doubtful too.<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Joyce Weltem, a merchant I knew who sold beasts among other things, wondered how that company could have that many rare articles, so he tried to search and reach out to their supplier&#8230; but <span lang=\"it-IT\">it was of no use</span>.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">As far as the public knew, there wasn&#8217;t any problem in Garamdoor&#8217;s conduct&#8230;<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"it-IT\">W</span>as that real?</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Zect <span lang=\"it-IT\">wouldn&#8217;t have</span> fussed over the fleeing beast <span lang=\"it-IT\">if it</span> was<span lang=\"it-IT\">n&#8217;t </span>precious&#8230;<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Still, I felt<span lang=\"it-IT\"> the</span> problem was probably way deeper than that.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Lady Leeza, why do you doubt them?”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Well, I heard about this only today, but it&#8217;s said that Garamdoor has obtained a beast called ice fox <span lang=\"it-IT\">that they want</span> to sell. Thing is that no one has ever seen it, and some wonder if it&#8217;s a phantom beast or not&#8230; but the strangest part is that its fur looks like a certain humanoid species.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">That was very specific&#8230; thank goodness none of the customers seemed to listen, so <span lang=\"it-IT\">we didn&#8217;t need</span> to <span lang=\"it-IT\">pretend it was just some</span> <span lang=\"it-IT\">rumors.</span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">A humanoid species&#8230;? Do you mean the ‘blue fox tribe’? Well, ice is indeed blue, but would that be the same for a beast&#8230;?”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Ah, Mister, you know them? I was <span lang=\"it-IT\">joking</span>, didn&#8217;t you get it&#8230;?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Exactly as the name suggests, the Blue fox tribe was formed by fox-like humanoids with blue fur.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Ahhh&#8230; Sorry I couldn&#8217;t tell you more. That<span lang=\"it-IT\">&#8216;s </span>all I <span lang=\"it-IT\">know for tonight</span>.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I found it very interesting, Lady Leeza. Later I will <span lang=\"it-IT\">make </span>you <span lang=\"it-IT\">receive </span>a good reward.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Really?! Thank you~♪ I&#8217;ll <span lang=\"it-IT\">let you know if I hear anything else</span>!”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Please do. I would be thrilled even to hear about your love life.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Verlaine loved gossip way more than <span lang=\"it-IT\">I did</span>. She knew every guild member&#8217;s love stor<span lang=\"it-IT\">y</span>.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Surprisingly enough, even the younger ones kept their distance if they didn&#8217;t have a real chance to get closer to each other. <span lang=\"it-IT\">For example, probably</span> Rigel&#8217;s team <span lang=\"it-IT\">would&#8217;ve</span> never seen Lia as one of <span lang=\"it-IT\">its members&#8217;</span> girlfriend.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Leeza was popular <span lang=\"it-IT\">in our guild</span>, given her <span lang=\"it-IT\">morals</span> and the right distance she put between her and boys. <span lang=\"it-IT\">S</span>he was <span lang=\"it-IT\">also</span> kind with everyone a<span lang=\"it-IT\">nd a</span> <span lang=\"it-IT\">hard worker</span> with a bright personality&#8230; <span lang=\"it-IT\">probably </span>her only problem was that she was too picky when it came to looks.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Well&#8230; I will take one last drink and go back home. Dick, what are you going to do about this?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Cody spoke almost in whispers. Of course, I was already wrecking my brain to solve th<span lang=\"it-IT\">is</span> mess.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"it-IT\">It</span> was <span lang=\"it-IT\">really</span> interesting. <span lang=\"it-IT\">Knowing something like this makes a huge difference</span>. <span lang=\"it-IT\">It made me want to keep drinking.</span>”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"it-IT\">Are you not </span>drunk <span lang=\"it-IT\">yet</span>? <span lang=\"it-IT\">Y</span>ou <span lang=\"it-IT\">keep your</span> eyes <span lang=\"it-IT\">peeled</span> more than anyone else in here.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Eheheh&#8230; <span lang=\"it-IT\">Actually, his eyes are always half-closed.</span> I<span lang=\"it-IT\">t has been a while since last time I saw them wide </span>open.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"it-IT\">When</span> I tried to open them wide as they said, both Cody and Verlaine started <span lang=\"it-IT\">laughing.</span></span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"CENTER\">◆◇◆</p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">After that Cody <span lang=\"it-IT\">had </span>left and the bar was closed, I sneaked out the backdoor while cleaning.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Someone&#8217;s there? I need some help.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Yes. How can I help you, Master?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Waiting there stood another member of the intelligence team, a werebeast and collegue of Leeza called Sakuya.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Both her hair and skin were white and her rabbit ears were proof of her ravirim lineage. Her kin&#8217;s hair <span lang=\"it-IT\">was colored</span>, but she was albino. Below her scarlet red eyes was a little mole which boosted her stiff-looking beauty.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Ravirims could cover the traces they left behind, their extremely sharp hearing made them hear what humans couldn&#8217;t, and they were perfect for mission<span lang=\"it-IT\">s</span> that required <span lang=\"it-IT\">nimble </span>adventurers. Also, their magic affinity was great, so their spells were usually better than the average ones.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">They were eye-catching and given the lack of clothes on their slender bodies, their sense of shame was quite different from a human&#8217;s. Letting their beauty in plain sight was a double-edged sword, but in our case, Sakuya was an S rank adventurer, so if some fool dared to lay his hands on her, he would probably <span lang=\"it-IT\">regret it in a few instants</span>.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Listen, I need a favor. Can you examine a place for me?”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"it-IT\">You mean this night?</span> Yes, I can. Do we have permission to do <span lang=\"it-IT\">that</span> or are we going to look for some kind of proof?”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Actually, the latter. Sorry for <span lang=\"it-IT\">not giving you more specific instructions</span>.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Don&#8217;t mention it. Your instructions are never flawed, Master. My duty is to inspect what you want.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">My guess was unfounded, but I was sure that Garamdoor was doing something that concerned both the blue fox tribe and that mysterious ice fox.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Demi-humans are involved in some unclear matter&#8230; Sorry, does this make you feel uneasy?”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">&#8230;Why are you apologizing, Master? You don&#8217;t discriminate us. If you say that something&#8217;s off, I will assist you to <span lang=\"it-IT\">find the truth</span>.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Can you go right away, then? I need to prepare some stuff for a mission that Rigel has accepted. Today another guild threatened to make a move against him.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Understood. This document should fill me with the details, right? I&#8217;ll take my leave.”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">She cast Hiding and disappeared before heading to Garamdoor&#8217;s company.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">This job was a lot of work, but gather<span lang=\"it-IT\">ing</span> information was necessary. If my guess was right, those guys were using some kind of magic tool to meddle in some way with demi-humans.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Master&#8230; do you really think that is the case?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">When I returned to the bar, Verlaine was waiting for me. Only a few chores were left.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Yes. Some demi-humans can shape-shift into their ancestors&#8217; form at will, so if there was a magic tool that could force the process&#8230;”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I did not think that far ahead&#8230; but it makes sense. I only assumed that some kind of magic could <span lang=\"it-IT\">block </span>their shape-shifting.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">If someone could cast a spell like that, we&#8217;d need to take precautions. Anyway, we need to gather more information about <span lang=\"it-IT\">this matter</span>.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Who knows what<span lang=\"it-IT\"> are we going to pull out of this hat</span>&#8230;<a class=\"sdfootnoteanc\" href=\"#sdfootnote2sym\" name=\"sdfootnote2anc\"><sup>2</sup></a> No matter how we look at it, this job will take an unexpected turn. How will we handle Zect?”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">If we do things the right way, we might make him join us. Even if our hierarchy is loosen, he should be fine as long as he keeps growing and improving, don&#8217;t you think?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">I didn&#8217;t know how she selected people for their jobs when she was a Demon Lord yet, and while she crossed her arms under her chest, she raised one of her fingers.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Strong people are not necessarily <span lang=\"it-IT\">good</span>, but we<span lang=\"it-IT\">&#8216;re currently</span> miss<span lang=\"it-IT\">ing</span> SS rank adventurers in our <span lang=\"it-IT\">guild</span>. If we could have one, we could make them collaborate with <span lang=\"it-IT\">fellow guildsmen</span>.<span lang=\"it-IT\"> It would trigger</span> a nice chain reaction.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Do you think so <span lang=\"it-IT\">too</span>? I agree with you.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"it-IT\">Grrr</span>&#8230; <span lang=\"it-IT\">I know we are often on the same wavelength, but</span>&#8230; <span lang=\"it-IT\">you are always so straight-laced&#8230; </span>still, the more you <span lang=\"it-IT\">are</span>, the more I get excited. I noticed it recently, though.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I&#8217;d love to ask you what are you talking about&#8230; just stop sneaking into my bed at night. Sakuya delivers me her reports during nighttime.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">What&#8217;s with that respectful tone about <span lang=\"it-IT\">her</span>&#8230;? <span lang=\"it-IT\">I am the older one between us. Y</span>ou should respect me more than <span lang=\"it-IT\">Sakuya</span>.”<br />\n</span>“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Oh, c&#8217;mon, don&#8217;t make a big deal out of it. I&#8217;ve always treated her like this, haven&#8217;t I?”</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">She <span lang=\"it-IT\">pouted</span> again but there wasn&#8217;t anything e<span lang=\"it-IT\">lse </span>behind <span lang=\"it-IT\">her groan</span>. When I first met that ravirim, <span lang=\"it-IT\">who looked like an adult compared to me,</span> I was only fourteen.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Anyway, I had to wait for the report and prepare what was necessary for Rigel.</span></p>\n<p lang=\"en-GB\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">If the beast they <span lang=\"it-IT\">were going to find</span> was a transformed demi-human that for some reason couldn&#8217;t revert to its other form, I <span lang=\"it-IT\">had </span>to find a way to dispel that block.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<div id=\"sdfootnote1\">\n<p class=\"sdfootnote\" lang=\"it-IT\"><a class=\"sdfootnotesym\" href=\"#sdfootnote1anc\" name=\"sdfootnote1sym\">1</a> It&#8217;s written “<span style=\"font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode;\">月兎人” </span>(literally “moon rabbit people” ) but furiganas say “<span style=\"font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode;\">ラヴィリム”</span>, so we went for “Ravirim”</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"sdfootnote2\">\n<p class=\"sdfootnote\"><a class=\"sdfootnotesym\" href=\"#sdfootnote2anc\" name=\"sdfootnote2sym\">2</a> The original uses a cute expression: “<span style=\"font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode;\">鬼が出るか蛇が出るか” </span>(literally “what will come out, a demon or a snake?”), which probably comes from those jack-in-the-box things.
