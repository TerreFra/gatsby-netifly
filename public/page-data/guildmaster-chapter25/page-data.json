I heard that they didn&#8217;t like having the entrance on the ground because earth dragons, their natural enemies, might sneak in during their absence, so that was probably something dictated by their instinct.</p>\n<p>As soon as we started to fly and exited the ranch, I noticed that our compass wasn&#8217;t working probably due to the magnetic minerals contained into the dragon&#8217;s skin&#8230; But we only needed to go east from the capital.</p>\n<p>Riding a dragon was exactly as Shura said: way more stable than riding a wyvern, and overall really comfortable.<br />\nThe dragon flute that I was wearing around my neck started to play whenever I poured magic into it, and our mount obeyed my every order.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Hey, you’re using some kind of magic, right? Now, I&#8217;m almost not frightened anymore.”<br />\n“Well, anyone would be afraid of experiencing this height for the first time, but being scared is risky, so I used Spirit guard.”<br />\n“You don&#8217;t enjoy seeing me afraid, huh? And here I thought you&#8217;d make fun of me&#8230;”<br />\n“I prefer to enjoy the view from up here, honestly. Don&#8217;t you think that being scared a little is worth being able to witness such an amazing scenery?”</p>\n<p>At first, she was rigid due to tension, but as time passed, she finally started to calm down and leaned her back on me. The paperwork must have worn her out.</p>\n<p>“I shouldn&#8217;t be heavy, but let me know if I am.”<br />\n“Nah, I&#8217;m surprised you&#8217;re this light. Even more than when I lifted you before.”<br />\n“G-Good&#8230; I guess it&#8217;s fine, then. You are thick-skinned, that&#8217;s probably why you don&#8217;t find me heavy.”<br />\n“You&#8217;re not as tall as a Deku stick, though. I can take books you can&#8217;t reach.”<br />\n“If I wore high shoes, I&#8217;d have reached them too, but they hurt my feet, so I don&#8217;t like them much.”</p>\n<p>We peacefully kept chatting on our way. No matter how big and filled with elites Velvechia&#8217;s army was, it was no match for us.</p>\n<p>The Republic of Velvechia was located beside the country of another Demon Lord, who, according to Verlaine, was only S rank, but since no one could defeat him, every year the cities sent him a lot of tributes to avoid facing an invasion. The strongest warriors in Velvechia were AA rank, with scores around twenty thousand, meaning that the average soldier was rank C or worse. It was pretty much on the same level of Albein.</p>\n<p>Still, Velvechia had yet to know about our expedition and victory against Verlaine, an SSS rank Demon Lord.</p>\n<p>The Duke of Vinceburg was thinking of crushing us with sheer numbers, but that was a miscalculation on his part.</p>\n<p>“I bet you&#8217;re thinking that we&#8217;re the adults going to stop a children&#8217;s fight&#8230; I&#8217;m feeling the same, you know?”<br />\n“Well, if we hadn&#8217;t taken part in the expedition against Verlaine, we wouldn&#8217;t have known our real power. Still, we&#8217;re clueless about how to handle fights between humans.”<br />\n“If we were to fight against a horde of monsters, I could just blow them away&#8230;”</p>\n<p>When we were traveling together, she did exactly that to a lot of monster dens, and if a demi-human race was using them for some reason, the nearby habitations would have been badly damaged too. Oh, and let&#8217;s not mention what became of the monsters&#8230;</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s how she earned her title as a raging calamity&#8230; Sweet disaster.</p>\n<p>“Dick, is that it? My sight is better than yours, isn’t it?”<br />\n“The zone is slightly clearer, and there are stone statues placed at a regular distance&#8230; That must be the path that Vinceburg arranged for Velvechia.”<br />\n“I can&#8217;t believe the ones who should protect us constructed that. Don&#8217;t you think they deserve some punishment?”<br />\n“Honestly, yes. If I&#8217;d anticipated this at the time of Manarina&#8217;s engagement, I could’ve settled everything without attracting attention&#8230;”<br />\n“If that was the case, you&#8217;d have become this country&#8217;s king&#8230; though, if someone asked for it when we got the chance, maybe the king himself would’ve allowed it.”</p>\n<p>I wanted to remind her that each one of us was indifferent to prestige.</p>\n<p>Especially Aileen, who could be called ‘Master Warrior’ by any fighter or martial artist&#8217;s teacher if only she wanted it.</p>\n<p>“Maybe I&#8217;ll try to make Aileen our ruler&#8230; Would that make her more responsible?”<br />\n“Nice idea, but she has horns. How is she supposed to wear a crown?”</p>\n<p>I laughed at her joke, which she rarely cracked. Sheesh, if I wasn&#8217;t tense, that&#8217;d have been heartwarming.</p>\n<p>A road trailed across the mountain, and following it with my gaze, I could see a village in the distance.</p>\n<p>“That&#8217;s the only village around here, right&#8230;? The enemy will surely pass by it.”<br />\n“Yeah&#8230; if it wasn&#8217;t there&#8230; Wait, what are those? Velvechia&#8217;s scouts?”<br />\n“Seems like that. Our country doesn&#8217;t use black armors&#8230;”</p>\n<p>She could see them well. Five knights clad in black armors, rufous mantles fluttering behind them, were galloping on the road.</p>\n<p>They were screaming wildly, bows in hand like hunters chasing their prey.<br />\nAt that moment, I was sure.<br />\nWhen they nocked their arrows, I firmly embraced Mylarka.</p>\n<p>“Wah! W-What are you doing?! W-We&#8217;re not here for&#8230;! Waaah!”<br />\n“They&#8217;re chasing someone. We&#8217;re swooping on them before it&#8217;s too late.”<br />\n“O-Oh&#8230; I-I see, okay. I&#8217;ll hold on tight.”</p>\n<p>She lowered her body as I flowed my will into the dragon flute, and our mount adjusted his wings to glide down the sky.</p>\n<p>“Ugh&#8230;! Wait, won&#8217;t they notice us like this&#8230;?”<br />\n“Don&#8217;t worry, I made the fire dragon eat some concealing pomegranate. No one will notice us before we get close, and their comrades, if there&#8217;s any, won&#8217;t see us from afar.”<br />\n“Oh, you got it covered already&#8230;? Okay, let&#8217;s sneak up on them and wrap things up quickly.”</p>\n<p>As we approached them, the knights didn&#8217;t notice anything, but the simple feeling of being targeted triggered their sixth sense.</p>\n<p>“S-Something is coming against us&#8230;”<br />\n“A&#8230; d-dragon! Captain, a dragon is&#8230;!”<br />\n“Where did that come from?! Damn, shoot it!”</p>\n<p>We swooped on them tracing an arc on the air, and as we closed the distance between us, I could see Sweet disaster&#8217;s body shrinking in my arms before glaring at them fiercely.</p>\n<p>“‘Restricted area annihilation n°66 – Disintegration field!’”</p>\n<p>She started to weave her magic field at an unfathomable speed, which enveloped the target in a mere instant, and activated it with a snap of her fingers.</p>\n<p>“What&#8217;s going on&#8230;?!”<br />\n“My bow and armor&#8230; Waaah!”</p>\n<p>They felt completely lost.<br />\nAfter a fire dragon grazed their heads, a terrific gust of wind made their horses stop, and their entire equipment turned into fine sand that fell on the ground and dispersed.</p>\n<p>When we regained altitude, I ordered the dragon to hover there.</p>\n<p>Their captain, who was younger than expected and now almost completely naked, turned his confused horse and looked up to us.</p>\n<p>“Who are you, Albein&#8217;s dragon masters?! Take off your stupid masks and show your face!”</p>\n<p>Seems like he still had the power to snarl at us, but riding a horse while in his underwear made his coercion attempt all the more ridiculous.</p>\n<p>Mylarka had spread her magic field with so much precision that their underwear was the only thing left to cover them. That was a sweet concern and an aberrant action at the same time.<br />\nAs far as I knew, only the two of us knew how to disassemble material into dust like that&#8230; and I believed that it was highly improbable to find someone with the same ability.</p>\n<p>After clearing her throat, Mylarka started to speak firmly.</p>\n<p>“You are from Velvechia, right? We have our reasons to prevent you from going back to your main army. Surrender now, and no blood will dye the earth.”<br />\n“I knew it, you&#8217;re from Albein&#8230; Damn those useless idiots&#8230;”</p>\n<p>I guessed that he was cursing Vinceburg. They had to keep everything a secret, so he was probably thinking that there was a spy among them.</p>\n<p>“Captain, we should try to run away! It will be enough if only one of us gets back home&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>Suggested a young man with a trembling voice, and no one replied as they moved to escape.</p>\n<p>“Mylarka, plug your ears.”<br />\n“Mh? Why?”</p>\n<p>I brought my hands to her ears and cast a protection spell on both of us. I took a moment to reflect before giving a new order to the dragon.</p>\n<p>It has been a while since last time I fely my heart pounding in combat, but thanks to Shura, who taught me the charm of dragon flutes, I was having a lot of fun fighting from the sky with Mylarka. If I had to say it like him, it was really exciting.</p>\n<p>“Groooarh!”</p>\n<p>The thunderous roar of our mount shook both air and earth: that was the daunting power of his voice.</p>\n<p>The horses cringed in terror and stopped moving, while the knights limply hung their heads in a trance.</p>\n<p>After that, we landed with a loud stomp, and Mylarka rose her voice.</p>\n<p>“Heavens might forgive you, but the shining eyes behind our masks shall not overlook wickedness!”</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t know how to react to that declaration&#8230; Our targets were in a trance and they probably didn&#8217;t hear her, but seeing her having fun while pridefully puffing out her chest was enough to make me want to sit back and see what was going to happen next.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Did you come up with that yourself or is it the masked saviors&#8217; catchphrase?”<br />\n“The former. Maybe I should add also a part that mentions the earth&#8230;”<br />\n“W-Well, you have a lifetime to think about it. By the way, where did the one they were chasing go?”</p>\n<p>As I surveyed my surroundings, the clapping of someone&#8217;s hands reached our ears, and when we turned to face its source, a demi-human lady, a bit younger than us, was hiding in the shade of a tree.</p>\n<p>“Mylarka, she likes us. Isn&#8217;t it great?”<br />\n“That&#8217;s only natural when someone saves you&#8230; but now I really need to complete the catchphrase. I knew it was a nice idea.”</p>\n<p>She was so happy that my cynicism didn&#8217;t go through her, and even though she should have acted more mature, she was really excited of being a warrior of justice, and that made me confirm again the age gap between us. I would&#8217;ve never said that she was childish, though. I didn’t really dislike this whole thing.</p>\n<p>If Aileen was around, she might have laughed at Mylarka without fear of the consequences, so it was better she wasn’t with us. The genius teacher made sure of our targets&#8217; powerlessness while thinking about her catchphrase.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the girl, who, given her ears and tail, was part of the tiger-race, kept clapping her hands with sparkling eyes.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/guildmaster-chapter24/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/guildmaster/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/guildmaster-chapter26/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1748\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"13269fe0a1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1748\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">4+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"Guild Master &#8211; Chapter 25","featured_media":{"id":"cdff1161-96fa-5aea-b3f3-f7e09589d9fd","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/guild-master-banner.png"},"categories":[{"id":"b4b11328-5f15-59d4-aa4c-61da5eedadce","name":"After defeating the Demon Lord, he became Guild Master"}],"excerpt":"<p>TL note: heartfelt thanks to Vorobyov Andrey, who donated us ten [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"guildmaster-chapter25"}}}
