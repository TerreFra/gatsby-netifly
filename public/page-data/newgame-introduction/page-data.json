You were saying that you can grant me any wish.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, exactly. You know, there’s plenty of people who fail to grasp the situation, given how sudden and unrealistic reincarnation is…”</p>\n<p>After a sigh of relief, she smiled again and asked:</p>\n<p>“So, what do you wish for?”</p>\n<p>“Please, enslave me.”</p>\n<p>“As. I. Said. You can ask for anything! Why do you keep saying that?!”</p>\n<p>Annoyed, the Goddess raised her voice and pointed her finger at him.</p>\n<p>He was very composed.<br />\nMoving her gaze from his lips, she looked into his eyes brimming with confidence.<br />\nShe crossed both arms and legs admiring his astonishing beauty from the height of her throne.<br />\nIt was clear that he firmly believed in himself.</p>\n<p>“You’ve asked me if I had a wish. So hurry and enslave me now, please.”</p>\n<p>“No, wait a moment. There are times when I’d like to have some company, but I’d never gotten as far as wanting a slave…”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want to be a slave of some God like you. I’m telling you to reincarnate me bound by chains, without properties or social status.”</p>\n<p>“You what? Isn’t this going too much toward bondage?!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t get the wrong impression. I meant that I want people to look down on me. Fortune, status, authority… It would be pointless if I can’t start from zero.”</p>\n<p>The Goddess was at a loss for words and squatted desperately. Since she started her work, she helped many people, but no one asked to be enslaved before.<br />\nThen, an idea suddenly popped into her head.</p>\n<p>“Oh, I see! You want to start as a slave and become the strongest with your hidden powers, right?! I get it, I get it. Now tell me which ability…”</p>\n<p>“Try to give me anything special and next time we see each other I’m going to beat you to death.”</p>\n<p>“Why?! I just want the best for you as a Goddess!”</p>\n<p>Her eyes welled with tears as she didn’t know how to deal with that man anymore.<br />\nHe snorted, bored at that reaction.</p>\n<p>“If you help me in any way, my regret will never fade. Let me reincarnate with my memories and appearance, please.”</p>\n<p>“Eh…? Well, you’d keep your memories anyway… I could copy your body and make sure it grows accordingly, but…”</p>\n<p>“But? Is there any problem?”</p>\n<p>“Well… to put it simply, you’d die. You’re going in a world where magic and magical creatures exist. If you don’t have any ability, I can’t help but think that you want to die…”</p>\n<p>“It’s fine. I have a regret despite the fact I was surrounded by wealth.”</p>\n<p>The Goddess tilted her head, intrigued by the man smiling brightly.</p>\n<p>“Err… By the way, what do you regret so much? You keep saying you want to start from zero, but wouldn’t it better to have a handy power?”</p>\n<p>“What? You’re a Goddess, you should know this.”</p>\n<p>“Well, people depict Gods as high-ranked entities… but let’s say that actually we have a sort of people management role…”</p>\n<p>“I couldn’t care less of your conditions, but thank you anyway. Keep up the hard work.”</p>\n<p>More than showing sympathy for the depressed Goddess, the man started explaining.</p>\n<p>“My life was way too easy.”</p>\n<p>The Goddess couldn’t grasp the meaning of his words, hence she frowned and asked –</p>\n<p>“You mean that… you regret the fact that you never had problems?”</p>\n<p>As she looked at him suspiciously, the man started to tell his story…</p>\n<p>“You know, I was good at everything. Once I decided to do something, it always turned out just like I wanted. To the point that I never regretted anything.”</p>\n<p>Those words sounded sarcastic, but his expression was dead serious.<br />\nAs the man remembered his past, a gloomy shadow dropped over his eyes.</p>\n<p>“But… before my death I realized that… I was ‘regretting’ it. The truth is, I haven’t achieved anything with my abilities alone. My circumstances simply let me be a step up other people.”</p>\n<p>He looked down, then wore his usual smile.</p>\n<p>“That’s why I want to reincarnate in the most cruel environment. In order to know how far I can go on my own… Are you listening?”</p>\n<p>As he played his monologue, the Goddess stared at him with a freezing gaze.</p>\n<p>“Yes, of course I am. So, it is just the whim of a spoiled child. Holy me, people’s bragging is really boring. It was so boring I almost thought I was listening to my superior&#8217;s old stories.”</p>\n<p>“The world of gods is also tough, huh? In that case, please, let me reincarnate and sink in this insane hard-mode.”</p>\n<p>“I’d do it even if you hadn’t asked. Luckily, I found a world that fits your preferences. Go die in a hole or by the roadside as soon as you set foot in there, thanks.”</p>\n<p>“Can you refrain from wishing my death? It’s not cool. Anyhow, as long as I have my hope, everything will be all right.”</p>\n<p>She sighed as opposed to the man’s dazzling smile.</p>\n<p>After a few moments, under his feet shone a faint blue light that enveloped him.<br />\nHe started to vanish like he was being sucked by it.<br />\nThe Goddess, who had been pouting for a while now, remembered that she had a duty to fulfill, so she cleared her throat and bid him farewell with a tender smile.</p>\n<p>“Well then, I wish you a new life with no more regrets!”</p>\n<p>He simply returned a smile.</p>\n<p>After that… the man who regretted not having regrets started his new life.</p>\n<hr />\n<p lang=\"en-US\" style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/newgame/\">Index </a>| <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/newgame-chapter1/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n</div><div class=\"fusion-clearfix\"></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div></div></div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" ><div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1230\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"88f12b2905\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1230\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">3+</span>\t\t\t</div></div>\n\t","title":"New Game &#8211; Introduction","featured_media":{"id":"f7196a99-3aa6-576c-bfdc-d3a4aafea738","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/newgame-banner.png"},"categories":[{"id":"711623f2-28a0-57e3-9ad6-85a46264a357","name":"A New Game from the Depths of Captivity!"}],"excerpt":"<p>3+</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-introduction"}}}
