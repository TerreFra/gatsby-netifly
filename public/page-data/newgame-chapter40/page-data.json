The dim sources of light glowing around were scattered magic tools. Natural light never reached that place.</p>\n<p>Kiad was cowering on the floor, his body shaking. What had been of his brawny figure was now gone. He looked one or two sizes smaller and weaker than before.<br />\nNo light shone in his dead-looking eyes as he scanned around the room.</p>\n<p>What was placed on his desk was now littering the floor. All his documents were torn to pieces and chunks of wood lied nearby the walls—they were probably former chairs he had smashed.</p>\n<p>Kiad had been deprived of his magic power. Takumi cast him in that hell after their fight.<br />\nHe could no longer active any of the law formulas his father had researched for so long.<br />\nDespite being blood-related to Elvis, he never tasted his father&#8217;s benevolence or mercy. All he had to do was not to fail, and if he did once, he wasn&#8217;t allowed to a second time.</p>\n<p>Elvis, who only cared about the sheer power of people, wouldn&#8217;t let his children inherit the family&#8217;s headship only because they were his legitimate sons. Sigurd—Kiad&#8217;s younger brother—had been chosen to be the heir to the throne given his diligence to his father&#8217;s orders.<br />\nHe never failed to complete one.</p>\n<p>On the other hand&#8230; Kiad&#8217;s destiny was to become a miserable laughing stock if people came to know he had lost his magic power.</p>\n<p>“I&#8230; I won&#8217;t fail again&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>He squeezed those words out of his throat, but his hand tremors betrayed his confidence.<br />\nThe afterimage of that obnoxious, triumphant smile was burnt in his mind—it flickered endlessly, and so did his fortitude.<br />\nHe had walked on his path through life by believing in himself and acting as he wanted&#8230; but now he couldn&#8217;t take a single step forward—no future pictured him victorious.</p>\n<p>“If only&#8230; If only I had won that battle&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>He firmly believed he could win the match Elvis had stopped. He knew he could&#8217;ve won against Takumi back then. This wasn&#8217;t his arrogance talking, it was just a matter of fact—Kiad was definitely strong and possessed the strongest magic in the entire Kingdom, the valiant Fortesea&#8217;s. That slave merchant didn&#8217;t stand a chance to win against him.<br />\nHowever, Elvis wasn&#8217;t sure of it, so things turned out like this. His father had denied him that victory.</p>\n<p>“Right&#8230; it wasn&#8217;t my fault&#8230;! I wasn&#8217;t the cause of my defeat&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>Yes, his father had just grown old and coward&#8230; he didn&#8217;t need to care about him.<br />\nHe only had to be himself&#8230; and act as he wanted to.<br />\nThe moment a breath of relief blew into him, he heard someone knocking on the door.</p>\n<p>“I SAID I DON&#8217;T WANT TO MEET—”</p>\n<p>“Don&#8217;t you dare to speak to your father like that.”</p>\n<p>Kiad grasped right away who was talking and shrunk even further.<br />\nThe door opened slowly, letting in the ticking sound of his cane tapping the floor.</p>\n<p>“I haven&#8217;t seen your face in a while&#8230; you look awful.”</p>\n<p>The man&#8217;s grave voice fit his stony expression, as he looked down his pitiful son.</p>\n<p>“Father&#8230; why are you here?”</p>\n<p>“What a strange question. A father should visit his sons when they&#8217;re moping.”</p>\n<p>Kiad clicked his tongue in his mind at those shameless words. He knew his father had just lied. Elvis Fortesea didn&#8217;t have the slightest ounce of familial love within him—his sons were just useful or useless beings like any other.</p>\n<p>“I ordered Suzuran&#8217;s slave merchant and his attendants to hunt some monsters.”</p>\n<p>“Hunt some monsters&#8230;?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. This time I&#8217;m worried, so I took the right measures.”</p>\n<p>Strangely enough, there was a shade of emotions in Elvis&#8217; voice.</p>\n<p>“Putting your failure aside, my blood runs through your veins. As opposed to Sigurd, who would be a mere nobody without me, you have the makings of a Valiant Fortesea&#8230; I&#8217;m here to grant you a chance to redeem yourself, although I never invested my time on you so far. Help me, instead of rotting away in a place like this.”</p>\n<p>Kiad raised his head, light returning to his eyes—his father had praised him.</p>\n<p>“Will you&#8230; let me redeem myself?”</p>\n<p>“Why wouldn&#8217;t I? This is my consideration for my son.”</p>\n<p>“I&#8230; I will surely repay your kindness.”</p>\n<p>Kiad bowed his head down.<br />\nHe didn&#8217;t expect his father to show him any mercy&#8230; but now, he could have his revenge. He could fan its flames by seething anger and hatred. That obnoxious slave merchant would pay for what he had done.</p>\n<p>“I already sent a message to Sigurd. He&#8217;s incompetent but he obeys my words. He should be heading to Renunt by now.”</p>\n<p>“Sigurd&#8230;? So will he use Denmerg&#8217;s monsters?”</p>\n<p>“Of course. That slave merchant might hinder my plans, so burning his surroundings to the ground and letting him squirm in despair is the least he deserves.”</p>\n<p><em>Tack, tack</em>—Elvis repeatedly stabbed the ground with his cane.<br />\nTakumi wasn&#8217;t someone he could just mess around with, so he carefully gathered enough resources to take him down.</p>\n<p>“If I use the magic crystal that Archbishop Crest made for you, our plan will be perfect&#8230; and there&#8217;s no way it won&#8217;t be, so there&#8217;s nothing to fear.”</p>\n<p>Kiad was paying particular attention to his father&#8217;s words. When he perceived the glacial tone in the old man&#8217;s voice, he suddenly understood that something was off.</p>\n<p>“So&#8230; what should I do for you, father?”</p>\n<p>“Mh? Do you not understand?”</p>\n<p>“I apologize&#8230; As far as I grasped, the plan is to make Sigurd crush them. That&#8217;s why you ordered him to go to&#8230;”</p>\n<p>“Do you not understand, Kiad?”</p>\n<p>His father interrupted him brazenly and stabbed him on the chest with his cane, a brimming smile distorting his face.</p>\n<p>“Ouch&#8230;! What&#8230;?”</p>\n<p>Kiad let out a dumb voice when he looked down to see the butt end of the cane piercing him.</p>\n<p>“I see&#8230; so he did something to you. Given that you can&#8217;t use magic or activate magic tools, he must have messed up your magic formula, huh&#8230;?”</p>\n<p>Elvis kept stabbing his son&#8217;s chest, his expression never changing. His heartless gaze made him look like he was looking down on a worm.</p>\n<p>“This is my consideration for you. My plan would be flawless without you&#8230; so don&#8217;t be afraid of the future and depart to the same sky all the heroes are sleeping in.”</p>\n<p>“Don&#8217;t&#8230; mess with me&#8230;! Are you saying I should die here&#8230;?!”</p>\n<p>Kiad grabbed the cane that was stabbing him, trying to defend himself, but the slender arms of the old man were insanely strong, and gradually his stabs became harsher.</p>\n<p>“You are miserable, Kiad.”</p>\n<p>When his cane impaled his son, he twisted it and saw Kiad spitting an ominous amount of blood.</p>\n<p>“You&#8217;re way too incompetent and you&#8217;ve always failed to notice. You&#8217;re just a worthless nobody who thinks too much of himself, and you even failed to follow my steps. Your smoldered, almost non-existent ambition is but a fragment of wisdom&#8230; but let me tell you something.”</p>\n<p>His cold words cut Kiad like a knife as he readied to stab him again in the hole he had dug on his chest.</p>\n<p>“The only reason you are alive was to breed so that the blood of Fortesea could keep flowing through this world after my death&#8230; that was the only expectation I had for you, and yet you couldn&#8217;t live up to that too. You&#8217;re just a useless pig groveling on this earth.”</p>\n<p>Elvis never stopped stabbing his son while talking.</p>\n<p>“Still, I found some worth into your uselessness. Even a waste like you could be a pawn against that obnoxious slave merchant. Rejoice, for your end has now a meaning that it wouldn&#8217;t have had otherwise. First, you let that slave merchant get the better of you—dancing on his palm like a puppet has been ridicule of you—then you let him take Lise away from you, and lastly you let him destroy your magic formula, which was something inviolable. No one must know about it.”</p>\n<p>When his son&#8217;s consciousness started to dim, Elvis remembered something and stopped for a moment his lunatic assault.</p>\n<p>“Right&#8230; I almost forgot to tell you. This is the first time you&#8217;ve been of any use to me, dear son.”</p>\n<p>His expression was stony and cold as he watched the light in Kiad&#8217;s eyes die out.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/newgame-chapter39/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/newgame/\">Index</a> | Next&gt;</p>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" ><div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"2745\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"6b1570864c\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_2745\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">0</span>\t\t\t</div></div>\n\t","title":"New Game &#8211; Chapter 40","featured_media":{"id":"f7196a99-3aa6-576c-bfdc-d3a4aafea738","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/newgame-banner.png"},"categories":[{"id":"711623f2-28a0-57e3-9ad6-85a46264a357","name":"A New Game from the Depths of Captivity!"}],"excerpt":"<p>What was of the man who opened the birdcage &#8211; [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-chapter40"}}}
