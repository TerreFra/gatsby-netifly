Hope I can get back on track soon.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">The volunteer soldiers and the monsters</h3>\n<p>The flying unit approached the incoming wave while clutching the bags with their claws.</p>\n<p>“Guuuys! When we get over them, rip your bags!”</p>\n<p>Harpy, their leader, started ordering the griffins and hippogriffs lined up behind her.<br />\nWhen they got close enough, blacksmiths and carpenters&#8217; lumps of discarded metal fell from the cuts on the bags. Sword and axes didn&#8217;t deal much damage when threw, but metal falling from a vertiginous height became a deadly weapon, considering the acceleration and impact.<br />\nCountless monsters let out cries of pain under them. It was a simple, one-sided and nightmarish assault that could reach even the rear-guard of the enemy lines.</p>\n<p>But this time, the enemy was a large number of starving beasts, none of which intelligent enough to escape after suffering from something that devastating.<br />\nMany monsters instantly died, but those who survived maintained their march while stepping over their comrades’ corpses and dividing into groups.</p>\n<p>“Now it&#8217;s our turn!”</p>\n<p>A huge butterfly, Papillon, the leader of the second flying unit, spoke from behind Harpy.<br />\nThis unit&#8217;s duty was to attack the monsters who tried to jump over the corpses to avoid the piles of metal and corpses.</p>\n<p>Slowing the wave down was one of Raiz and the others&#8217; tactics. Decimating the front guard while the rear one was falling behind gave them enough time to regroup and focus on fewer targets.</p>\n<p>“They&#8217;re starting to split! Third unit, it&#8217;s time to destroy them!”</p>\n<p>The volunteer soldiers fired their arrows at once, and despite many of them missed their target, the outcome wasn’t bad.<br />\nThat was possible only thanks to the hordes&#8217; sheer number, given that aiming wasn&#8217;t necessary to hit.</p>\n<p>Still, the monsters never stopped advancing.<br />\nIf things kept going that way, it wouldn&#8217;t have taken them much to reach the walls&#8230;<br />\nThen, rustling sounds and thuds arose from their front line, who disappeared into dark holes on the ground: the traps. Wandworm dug them all around the city.<br />\nThey were seven meters deep, three meters large, and their walls were hard to climb.</p>\n<p>“Good! Close combat unit, finish those in the traps!”</p>\n<p>The soldier immediately followed the commander&#8217;s order, and they started to attack the monsters with special spears that were longer than the average ones.<br />\nThose who didn&#8217;t meet Lety&#8217;s standard were assigned to that role.<br />\nThe fallen monsters couldn&#8217;t attack back or dodge the spear strikes, considering the small space they were confined in. That way, even amateurs could still one-sidedly kill their targets.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the experienced soldiers and Raiz&#8217;s monsters had started to move&#8230;</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter26/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/monstersguild/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter28/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1739\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"793f3c8d54\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1739\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">2+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"Monsters&#8217; Guild &#8211; Chapter 27","featured_media":{"id":"0d92c2f4-93f0-5f5c-96b4-1f4f6b5bd939","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/monsters-guild-banner-1.png"},"categories":[{"id":"30e10852-d86d-5f1d-b35d-f45bf02d53e9","name":"Welcome to the Monsters Guild!"}],"excerpt":"<p>TL note: sorry for the irregular releases but summer weakens [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"monstersguild-chapter27"}}}
