It’ll be fine even without fighting!”</em></p>\n<p>“Say what? This way is cooler!”</p>\n<p><em>“If you shatter the window and some little fragment remains on the floor, it will cause troubles to the next guests that will book this room, don&#8217;t you think?”</em></p>\n<p>“Oh, right. The inn personnel didn&#8217;t do anything wrong, so it would be bad for them.”</p>\n<p>She bumped her fist on her palm after sincerely agreeing with me.</p>\n<p>“But I might break stuff when we fight. I wanna punish them.”<br />\n<em>“Well, I guess that can&#8217;t be helped&#8230; just try not to as much as you can.”</em><br />\n“Sure thing~ ♪ Let&#8217;s start!”</p>\n<p>Aileen was honest, but she was somehow naive. She probably didn&#8217;t even consider that the employees of the inn might spread bad rumors about the masked saviors if we broke something&#8230; or maybe it was just me exaggerating when it came to these things.</p>\n<p>“Well, the door isn&#8217;t locked, so I guess I&#8217;ll simply enter. Excuse me~!”</p>\n<p>The window opened with a clatter, and she climbed over the windowsill while the presents stared at her flabbergasted for a few instants.</p>\n<p>After she jumped down and landed without a sound, one of the men moved his hands angrily.</p>\n<p>“W-Who the hell are you?! An underling of the empire?! Or an enemy?!”<br />\n“Sir Lang, we&#8217;ve been found out!”<br />\n“What are you waiting for?! Call the guards before&#8230;”<br />\n“Before what?”<br />\n“Iik!”</p>\n<p>She closed the distance with the man who was trying to leave the room in the blink of an eye and grabbed his shoulder.</p>\n<p>She was wearing a heavy-looking coat, but her movements were silent and quick.<br />\nEven the members of the tiger-race, renowned for their speed, wouldn&#8217;t have had a chance against her.</p>\n<p>“I haven&#8217;t done anything, yet&#8230; even though it sounds boring, I can&#8217;t hurt you much&#8230; Thing is, I heard quite a number of nasty things from you guys, so you reap what you sow. At least your guards seem to know how to fight.”<br />\n“R-Run&#8230;!”<br />\n“Right. I don&#8217;t wanna be seen fighting, but Di&#8230; I mean, I don&#8217;t mind him.”</p>\n<p>She was lightning fast. Before the two guards outside the door could enter, I saw her figure splitting into four, moving around the room and making the four men pass out with a blow. It looked like some kind of magic, but actually those were mere afterimages.<br />\nThat was just how skilled she was in martial arts.</p>\n<p>The men fainted in silence, but I saw that she went easy on the one called Lang. She probably wanted to gather information from him later.</p>\n<p>Right now, I looked like a little light insect or an orb of light, but my score was around fifty thousand. Even if our enemies were on par with SS ranked adventurers, Aileen&#8217;s inhuman speed was barely perceptible, and her score exceeded a hundred thousand points merely with her close combat abilities.</p>\n<p>“That was a superior hand-to-hand technique called ‘Carnage phantom fist’. Sorry for using something this plain.”</p>\n<p>No matter who would look at it, that was anything but plain. Also, she didn&#8217;t even break a sweat&#8230; it looked like a piece of cake for her.</p>\n<p>“Next are the guards&#8230; but I bet they&#8217;re hiding something in their clothes.”</p>\n<p><em>“Aileen, watch out! He&#8217;s gonna throw you something!”</em></p>\n<p>When the two guards stepped into the room, one of them threw a couple of knives he took from under his mantle to her.</p>\n<p>Aileen grinned and deflected their trajectory with her fists, which led them to stick in the wall.</p>\n<p>“Nice moves, but aiming at a girl&#8217;s face is mean.”<br />\n“Ugh&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>The man didn&#8217;t expect her to deflect the knives, and prepared for another attack.</p>\n<p>“Leave her to me! Aaah!”</p>\n<p>The other one unsheathed his sword and charged Aileen, trying to slash and stab her numerous times, but she kept dodging his attacks with a smile on her face.</p>\n<p>“You think you have more chance to win using a sword against me?”</p>\n<p>“Shut up!”</p>\n<p>The man wearing a helm was successfully provoked by her words and recklessly kept attacking.</p>\n<p>“Ya-ah!”</p>\n<p>She yelled in the spur of the moment, and faking a parry, she avoided his lunge and hit him on the head, sending him flying. The average fighter would never be able to avoid such a hit.<br />\nHer overcoat fluttered, showing her long, slender legs from beneath the slit of her skirt.</p>\n<p>“Take this!”<br />\n“Wah&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>As she was taking her overcoat off, the other man threw another knife that pierced through it and left a hole behind.<br />\nDid he foresee her action&#8230;? No, that was probably a coincidence.</p>\n<p>“Damn! Di&#8230; I mean, he gave me this, and it&#8217;s also one of my favorites! Now you&#8217;ve really done it!”</p>\n<p>I wondered what she was talking about. Well, at least she didn’t get stabbed.</p>\n<p>“Don&#8217;t take us easily!”</p>\n<p>The man who was sent flying by Aileen had moved around her and started another assault. He was probably an A rank swordsman, given how precise his slashes were, but that wasn&#8217;t enough to best the strongest martial artist in the kingdom.</p>\n<p>“Hah!”</p>\n<p>She let out a yelp and stood in a firm pose called ‘Rending lightning’, which was used to focus all the power to kill the target in a single blow.</p>\n<p>The man tried to attack Aileen again, but she ducked in response. Taking advantage of her lower position to counterattack with the base of her palm, she aimed at the weak point of the sword, which broke with a sharp sound, then she sprang and forcefully hit the man behind her.</p>\n<p>Secret superior hand-to-hand technique: Star collider rakshasa. She stretched her wonderful legs and crashed on him, who let out a gruesome sound before ramming into the wall. Several seconds later, the gravity brought him back to the floor.</p>\n<p>The other man didn&#8217;t run, and tried to take advantage of the situation to throw another knife to her back.<br />\nAn A rank adventurer might have avoided that&#8230; but the difference between that level and an SSS rank&#8217;s was just abysmal.</p>\n<p>“Hah!”</p>\n<p>She twisted her body and drew an arc with her white leg. After the blast made the knife stop in mid-air, she kicked it directly and sent it back, piercing the man’s shoulder and the door, sealing his movements.<br />\nI couldn&#8217;t believe my eyes&#8230; Was that really possible?<br />\nAs I watched her in awe, I hoped to see more of her techniques.</p>\n<p>“Ugh&#8230; M-Monster&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>She then briskly walked to him.</p>\n<p>“I&#8217;ll pay for the door later. My boss cares about these kinds of things.”<br />\n“&#8230;Huh?”</p>\n<p>She took the Rending lightning pose again and got ready to vent her frustration onto him. At that moment, even the ground seemed to tremble.</p>\n<p>“Atatatatatatata!”</p>\n<p>Aileen trashed the poor man at an inhuman speed. Her blows were so strong that they left countless dents on the door behind him.</p>\n<p>“Guah&#8230;”</p>\n<p>He fainted as his eyes rolled back. His clothes were destroyed.<br />\nShe was really angry for what happened to her overcoat, and I couldn&#8217;t really understand if I was more uneasy about that or sorry for the poor guy who enraged her.</p>\n<p>Now that the men were knocked out, she breathed in and kicked the air a few times before standing in a victorious pose.</p>\n<p>“We shall not overlook the wickedness crawling in the world as we assist people in need! The unbeatable masked saviors are here!”</p>\n<p>Why did she say it now that no one could hear her? I mean, even Mylarka did the same after defeating those guys, but&#8230; was introducing yourselves necessary? Still, although I didn&#8217;t want to stand out, I knew that doing it must have felt great.</p>\n<p><em>“Your catchphrase is different from Mylarka&#8217;s.”</em><br />\n“Eh? What does she say? We should talk it over with Yuma next time we see, but mine is cooler, right?”<br />\n<em>“Slightly&#8230; I didn&#8217;t do anything to help you, though.”</em><br />\n“If I went all out, they wouldn&#8217;t have survived. I bet you&#8217;re way stronger than them, though! Wanna try fighting?”<br />\n<em>“No, thank you. Anyway, what Lang said is a problem. Aileen, sorry for troubling you again, but can you be Manarina and her sisters&#8217; bodyguard for a while?”</em><br />\n“Yeah, no problem. What do you wanna do with these guys? Should I ask the guild to seize them?”</p>\n<p>Except for Lang, who was tied up as we talked, the other three men and two guards weren&#8217;t going to wake up any soon, and Vinceburg would have noticed for sure that someone was trying to sabotage their plans.</p>\n<p><em>“Let&#8217;s ask a few things to Lang, first. When will Velvechia attack us?”</em><br />\n“The first contact&#8230; will be tomorrow&#8230; Lord Jean will take advantage&#8230; of the opening&#8230;”</p>\n<p>I had imagined it. Jean, who couldn&#8217;t even defeat the princess, was seen as useless from his allies, so he arranged the preparations for this invasion, but then they ignored him.</p>\n<p><em>“Did you want to live the rich&#8217;s life after selling the kingdom?”</em><br />\n“&#8230;When Velvechia reaches the border&#8217;s fortress&#8230; we planned to surrend-oof!”</p>\n<p>Aileen headbutted him. Her strength when she got angry was terrifying&#8230;<br />\nThe spirit race was filled with inflexible people, and their power was no joke.</p>\n<p>“That&#8217;s stupid! If we lose our kingdom, whaddya think it&#8217;ll happen?! I must punish those idiots who listen to you. Dick, can I?”<br />\n<em>“I know that feeling, but wait a minute. We just need to show them what we&#8217;re made off. Can you tell everything to Cody before meeting Manarina?”</em><br />\n“Yeah. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll be glad to help his l–I mean, friend.”<br />\n<em>“What was that&#8230;? Anyway, we have to rely on the hero wielding the sword of light.”</em></p>\n<p>The Kingdom of Albein had the expedition party, an unbeatable team that became the masked saviors, among its ranks.</p>\n<p>Cody – Holy sword of light, was the best way to show Velvechia how futile was their move.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;By the way, I did a roundhouse kick before. Did you see anything?”<br />\n<em>“&#8230;Do you really want to know?”</em><br />\n“Waaah! M-My panties are pretty today, but I absolutely didn&#8217;t want you to see &#8217;em! Forget it! Now!”<br />\n<em>“I might have glimpsed something white, but I guess it was only my imagination.”</em><br />\n“N-No, stop it! Red is fine, but white isn&#8217;t!”</p>\n<p>Aileen – Charming goddess of wrath. I still had to see the ultimate form of her title, but seeing her dance-like fighting style, made me confirm how vibrant the ‘charming’ part was.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/guildmaster-chapter27/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/guildmaster/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/guildmaster-chapter29/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1831\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"b3c69dbe62\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1831\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">3+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"Guild Master &#8211; Chapter 28","featured_media":{"id":"cdff1161-96fa-5aea-b3f3-f7e09589d9fd","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/guild-master-banner.png"},"categories":[{"id":"b4b11328-5f15-59d4-aa4c-61da5eedadce","name":"After defeating the Demon Lord, he became Guild Master"}],"excerpt":"<p>The dancing fighter and the road toward peace Aileen took [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"guildmaster-chapter28"}}}
