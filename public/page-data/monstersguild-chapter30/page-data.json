Gimme more!”</p>\n<p>People were drinking and wolfing down food, while others were improvising some strange dances, but everyone was enjoying the victory to the fullest.</p>\n<p>“In the end, we managed to win.”</p>\n<p>Lety was slowly chewing the cooked meat of a monster they killed in the afternoon.<br />\nCommanding amateurs wore her out more than she expected, so she was extremely tired.</p>\n<p>“We didn&#8217;t have casualties, but many were injured. Thanks to Unicorn&#8217;s treatment, their life is not in danger anymore, but they’ll need to rest for some time.”</p>\n<p>“Seems like the adventurer guild will help for that. They offered to provide medical discounts to those who got injured in battle.”</p>\n<p>Raiz was relieved to hear that. He got close to the townspeople, so he was honestly happy.</p>\n<p>“By the way, what was that frog?”</p>\n<p>Lety recalled the apostle of Bael.</p>\n<p>“Can demons simply be born like that? Aren&#8217;t they summoned with some sort of ritual?”</p>\n<p>She was ignorant when it came to magic, and as far as she knew, only occultic and questionable parties summoned them by offering some living sacrifice in their rituals&#8230; or so she heard when she was a child.</p>\n<p>“If the right conditions are met, the presence of a summoner is not necessary. I don’t think there was one this time.”</p>\n<p>He didn&#8217;t have enough information, so that was the only conclusion he could come to.</p>\n<p>“Also, if demons could only be summoned, how could the first guy who summoned one come up with the right ritual? You can&#8217;t know the ritual if you don&#8217;t know the summon, don&#8217;t you think?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you&#8217;re right.”</p>\n<p><em>What should I eat next, some eggs or some chicken meat?</em><br />\nAs Lety was stuck with that doubt in her mind, she agreed and accepted Raiz&#8217;s explanation.</p>\n<p>“Oh well, let&#8217;s enjoy this night!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">◆</p>\n<p>“Here, Lamia. Have this too.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you.”</p>\n<p>The nearby old women kept offering her food, and she gleefully accepted more and more, despite having her hands already full.<br />\nHer duty was simple, but essential: bringing arrows and supplies on the walls as fast as she could while they were under siege.</p>\n<p>“Here, Unicorn, have a carrot.”</p>\n<p>“Why&#8230; I spent all my time healing people in the rearguard, so how come that only old-farts are thanking me?!”</p>\n<p>He was always the same.</p>\n<p>Nearby Raiz&#8217;s ranch was Dragon, who watched over the festival from the distance like a stranger.<br />\nHe was the only one there, but soon a lot of people went to him.</p>\n<p>“Oh, here it is! It&#8217;s here!”</p>\n<p>Drunk men were approaching him while holding booze and food.</p>\n<p>“Dragon, join our party!”</p>\n<p>“You deserve it, man! You kicked that monster&#8217;s ass in a jiffy!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, let&#8217;s have fun together!”</p>\n<p>“I refuse. I acted only because my Master wanted me to. Humans like you should be terrified of a dragon like me. ”</p>\n<p>“Oh, c&#8217;mon! Come have some fun!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah! Have some meat, here!”</p>\n<p>“Drink this!”</p>\n<p>“O-Oi, you&#8230;”</p>\n<p>One after the other, the drunkards placed food between Dragon&#8217;s claws like they were putting it in some storehouse.</p>\n<p>“Dig in! It&#8217;s super tasty!”</p>\n<p>“Ugh&#8230;”</p>\n<p>None of them was listening, but they were really convinced of their words.<br />\nIgnoring them would have been easy, but the feeling of food between his claws was annoying, so he brought everything to his mouth and swallowed it whole.</p>\n<p>“Woah! That&#8217;s a real drinker for you!”</p>\n<p>“A real eater, if anything!”</p>\n<p>“Gahahaha! Both are fine!”</p>\n<p>“Guys, let&#8217;s bring him more food!”</p>\n<p>“And more drinks!”</p>\n<p>The fearless drunkards set off and soon returned with more supplies.</p>\n<p>“You damn drunkards&#8230;”</p>\n<p>He cursed them but didn&#8217;t leave the place.<br />\nRaiz watched him from afar.</p>\n<p>“Oh, some guys are bringing him food?”</p>\n<p>He turned and looked at the people in the city having fun along with monsters.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Maybe we will really be accepted in this city.”</p>\n<p>The party grew livelier as the night grew deeper.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter29/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/monstersguild/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter31/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1824\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"b2d261edc6\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1824\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">2+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"Monsters&#8217; Guild &#8211; Chapter 30","featured_media":{"id":"0d92c2f4-93f0-5f5c-96b4-1f4f6b5bd939","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/monsters-guild-banner-1.png"},"categories":[{"id":"30e10852-d86d-5f1d-b35d-f45bf02d53e9","name":"Welcome to the Monsters Guild!"}],"excerpt":"<p>Victory party Torches lit the city as to drive the [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"monstersguild-chapter30"}}}
