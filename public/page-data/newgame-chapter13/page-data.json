Lots of fights, some even involving Valeria&#8217;s members, broke out.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The merchants kept bringing food and drinks in a hurry, maybe because they were also carried by the mood, or simply because Valeria was paying for them.<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">But the word ‘hurry’ couldn&#8217;t even start to describe how chaotic the situation was.<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Takumi was grabbing food nonchalantly, while Mirta, who looked like she was getting swallowed by the crowd, staggered while trying to reach him.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Hey, new boss, great work. It was tiring, huh?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Y-Yes&#8230; I am indeed a little tired.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Her face showed traces of fatigue, but talking with Takumi restored some of her vitality, and she was now smiling happily while blushing a little.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I understand that everyone is giving me their blessing, but&#8230; even though it is rude to say, a smaller celebration would have been&#8230;”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">No, we should do things this way. You have a small build compared to a man, so it was natural that party lovers would have thrown you in the air so many times.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I-If you saw that, why didn&#8217;t you save me?! It was scary! They threw me too high in the sky!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">You&#8217;re right, sorry. Next time I&#8217;ll help you.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">She was upset, but he decided to stroke her head lightly.<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">At that moment, someone called them.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Yaaay! Takumi, Mirtaaa! Wanna driiink?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Lilia approached them while carrying a bottle in her hand, her face slightly red.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Hey, Lilia. You&#8217;re having fun, huh.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Pretty muuuch! God Takumi, thanks for making me driiink!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">She said loudly. Usually, it didn&#8217;t matter how much she drank, her face never changed color. Seeing it red meant that she really drank a huge amount of alcohol.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Killfer is having fun and suffering at the same time&#8230; aren’t you, Mister Chaperone?” </span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Look at me&#8230; Do I look like I&#8217;m having fun?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">A blue shadow covered his face while he staggered behind Lilia.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Well, that&#8217;s your problem. I understand that you want to keep an eye on her, but what&#8217;s the point if you get tired before her?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">What can I do&#8230; We emptied a whole wine cask one</span><b> </b><span style=\"font-size: large;\">glass after the other&#8230; Do you know how many times she challenged me to a drinking contest&#8230;? Ugh&#8230;”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">He brought his hands to his mouth, probably remembering how much he drank, while the person in question was laughing mercilessly at him.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">You sure can&#8217;t handle alcohol, maaan!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Err&#8230; Lilia, you must have drunk quite a lot, but&#8230; will you be okay?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Eheheh~ You don&#8217;t haaave to worry! This is nothing for uuus!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Mirta tilted her head, unsure about the meaning of her words.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">You&#8217;ve done a looot for the slums, and we know it better than aaanyone else! Everyone knows that the things you said before in the plaza were your reeeal feelings! That&#8217;s why weee should celebrate your success from the bottom of our heaaarts!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">As to confirm Lilia&#8217;s cheerful words, the surrounding people started to shout Valeria&#8217;s and its leader’s name happily.<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Mirta&#8217;s declaration resonated with the slums inhabitants&#8217; feelings, and they were now blessing her sincerity.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Also, Takumi arranged aaall of thiiis! It would be a reeeal shame to waste this chance!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I only said that we&#8217;d pay for food and drinks, though.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Here he goes agaaain! You are always so humble, Takumiii~ Heeere, lemme show you some gratitude!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">A merry Lilia offered him the bottle she was holding.<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Seeing that, Mirta tried to stop her.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">What, no&#8230; Takumi, you&#8217;re not allowed to drink, understood? Elsa will come to check what&#8217;s going on, and we&#8217;ll have to explain everything.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Eh? I&#8217;m in the right mood to drink with them right now. Don&#8217;t worry, I won&#8217;t get drunk.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I&#8217;m not worried about that&#8230; Anyway, you can&#8217;t! I&#8217;m not saying you can&#8217;t drink for the rest of your days, I&#8217;m saying that this is not the right moment for that!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Remarked an obstinate Mirta.<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">While Takumi was thinking about what to do, Lilia squinted her eyes and whispered.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">What a nice view&#8230; A drunk husband getting scolded by his wife&#8230;”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">W-Wife&#8230;? Y-You said that I&#8217;m Takumi&#8217;s wife?!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Yass! Ya get along pretty well, ya know?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">The more she drank, the more her face reddened, and her speech pattern and movements started to resemble a drunkard&#8217;s.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Jeez, Lilia&#8230; you drank too much. Killfer, what are you waiting for? Take her away and let her rest.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Sorry&#8230; I can&#8217;t do that. She&#8217;d make me drink again on the way, and I&#8217;d end up barfing myself to sleep.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Find the courage to refuse, Mister Chaperone. I don&#8217;t think you will ever turn down Lilia&#8217;s invite, though.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Since Killfer never tried to restrain Lilia&#8217;s behavior, she was now like a hurricane.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Riiight! Leeet&#8217;s celebrate yer wedding ceremony together instead of her victory! Let&#8217;s have another toooast!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">How about no, you drunkard. C&#8217;mon, Mirta, tell her something.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Takumi shifted his gaze toward the girl, but she was muttering “His wife&#8230; She said I&#8217;m his wife&#8230;!” with her face as red as Mirta’s. It looked like she wasn&#8217;t going to help him.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">At that point, things got even more complicated.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">What?! Valeria&#8217;s boss and that slave merchant will get married?! For real?!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Nice move, Soft-hearted slave merchant!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">He can&#8217;t get away with this! Guys, let&#8217;s throw him in the air! Let&#8217;s show that lucky bastard the slums&#8217; blessing!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Damn yeah! He also helped Mirta and Valeria, after all! Let&#8217;s throw him into space, guys!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">As the drunkard&#8217;s nonsense spread, another commotion burst.<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Takumi let out a soft sigh.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Well&#8230; I&#8217;m the party organizer, looks like I deserve this&#8230;”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">He resigned to his fate, and as those sturdy men were about to lay their hands on him, a voice drowned out their roars&#8230;</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Heeey! Silence! Shut your mouths! What&#8217;s this?! Another festival?! No one notified me about this! I want some explanation! Slave merchant, show your face!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">A group of guards forced their way through the crowd. They all wore uniforms, and their leader had red hair tied in an updo.<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Panting heavily, Elsa appeared in front of Takumi.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Hey, Elsa. You took your sweet time, but thanks for saving me from a flight.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Y-You&#8230;! What on earth is going on here?! I want to hear what, how and why this is happening, you heard me?!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">He smiled at her rage.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Well, the Harvest Festival wasn&#8217;t enough.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">&#8230;What?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I mean, a peaceful festival like that can&#8217;t satisfy the slums&#8217; energetic people, so I just organized another one.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">N-No! The truth is that Valeria had to choose its new leafh&#8230;?!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Mirta tried to explain the situation, but Takumi shut her by placing a hand on her mouth.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">We can&#8217;t trouble the Captain of the Guard, so our leader was trying to control this commotion for Valeria&#8217;s honor. I should come with you to explain things, Miss.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">If you&#8217;re going with Elsa, I should also&#8230;”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">No, I’m enough. I’ll return to Valeria later, so put the situation under control in the meantime. We already dragged Elsa into this, but we shouldn&#8217;t bother even the other guards.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Valeria earned the slums&#8217; support thanks to what happened with Geiz.<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Then, the ruckus dragged there both Elsa and the guards.<br />\n</span><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Everything was going exactly as Takumi wanted.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">This is your first official job as our leader: end this before I come back. I believe that you can do it.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">He urged Mirta by pushing her back softly, and then faced the Captain of the Guards.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I will explain everything in detail. Shall we go to your station?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">We will have a long talk! C&#8217;mon, move!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">She grabbed him by the collar and dragged him toward their destination.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">Ah, Elsa. Sorry for asking, but might you wait a minute?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">&#8230;For what? Try to escape and I&#8217;ll knock you out.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">I won&#8217;t run, but since this will take a while, can I go grab some food?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span style=\"font-size: large;\">We have some at the station! Stop fooling around and hurry up!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">Even though she refused his request, the Captain of the Guards showed her tender side.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/project/newgame-chapter12/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/newgame/\">Index </a>| <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/newgame-chapter14/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n</div><div class=\"fusion-clearfix\"></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div></div></div>\t\t</p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1183\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"b23484099d\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1183\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">2+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"New Game – Chapter 13","featured_media":{"id":"f7196a99-3aa6-576c-bfdc-d3a4aafea738","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/newgame-banner.png"},"categories":[{"id":"711623f2-28a0-57e3-9ad6-85a46264a357","name":"A New Game from the Depths of Captivity!"}],"excerpt":"<p>2+</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-chapter13"}}}
