I preferred you last time.”</p>\n<p>“Guess I should be like that, then. Let&#8217;s avoid a roundabout speech.”</p>\n<p>As soon as he finished the sentence, someone hit him on his back.<br />\nWhen he turned to see who did it, he found an extremely displeased Lise.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;You are in the presence of Her Majesty. You must mind your tongue and your attitude.”</p>\n<p>“Can&#8217;t I just apologize for what I said?”</p>\n<p>“No. Keep going as long as Her Majesty wants.”</p>\n<p>“Okay, fine. My Queen, can I be forgiven?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, of course. Lise, do not bother Takumi.”</p>\n<p>Lise hung her head with puffed cheeks at that rebuke.</p>\n<p>“So, why was I brought here? There shouldn’t be any problems with the slaves I sent back home or with anything else.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed. The operation was flawless, and we have not received dissensions from the surrounding countries. This result is actually quite ideal.”</p>\n<p>As she spoke, Eluria turned to face him.</p>\n<p>“Let me express again my appreciation for your efforts. I expect great things from Suzuran.”</p>\n<p>“I&#8217;m glad for your words, but use the guards to call me, please.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, was Lise not to your liking?”</p>\n<p>“Of course not. Who would be glad of being dragged away by a holy warrior? For a moment I thought it was the inquisition.”</p>\n<p>Several orders of clergymen acted in the name of Filia.<br />\nThe most famous ones were the priests, who spread Her verb and lectured people, but among them were also the inquisition and soldier-like members, who were proficient in battle, called holy warriors.<br />\nThey were similar to fighting monks, who cultivated their doctrine, protected and taught people, but they also captured the heretics and purified the sinners.</p>\n<p>“Still&#8230; I didn&#8217;t expect the famous archbishop to be a child.”</p>\n<p>“Those who saw her had the same reaction, but Lise is a genuine holy warrior who earned such title.”</p>\n<p>“Indeed. My title is proof of my greatness.”</p>\n<p>She tried to puff her chest pridefully, but missing the raw material, it looked like she overstretched herself.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/iG4keoY.png?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Now it was clear why the Crest&#8217;s archbishop wasn&#8217;t a public figure.</p>\n<p>“Well, at that age is better not to go around much.”</p>\n<p>“We are not fond of exposing her to potential danger, and despite her being the genius who wrote the Law formula, Lise is still a child. Because of that, we allow her to move only in the most secure places, meaning the royal castle and the cathedral.”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;I could manage myself, since I am not a child anymore.”</p>\n<p>She looked depressed, but Eluria smiled happily.</p>\n<p>“It will be a problem if you get lost, is it not?”</p>\n<p>“It is fine as long as it does not happen.”</p>\n<p>“That is true, but given how lovable you are, what if some brute were to kidnap you?”</p>\n<p>“K-Kidnap me&#8230;? That sounds kind of bad.”</p>\n<p>“It does, right? Is it not better to stay here and talk with me, then?”</p>\n<p>Eluria hugged Lise, who was now shivering, and patted her on the head. The archbishop&#8217;s lack of freedom was probably caused by the queen&#8217;s worry, rather than her own will.</p>\n<p>“Her Majesty, you look quite fond of your doctrine&#8217;s archbishop.”</p>\n<p>“Eheheh&#8230; As the vessel of the Goddess&#8217; blood, I love my doctrine and children alike, albeit Lise is allowed to be by my side only temporarily.”</p>\n<p>“You mean officially?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. I asked the overlord of Fortesea to let their guest of honor come and talk with me in her free time.”</p>\n<p>Eluria smiled apologetically while the archbishop’s face clouded. Takumi shrugged his shoulder at them and let out a sigh.</p>\n<p>“Anyhow, I&#8217;m sorry, but being lead here by a child was painful.”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;I am not a child. Also, I have always been way more distinguished than you.”</p>\n<p>She said in a flat, indifferent tone.</p>\n<p>“First, to mistake me for someone of the inquisition should make you feel ashamed of yourself.”</p>\n<p>“I&#8217;m from the slums, you know? There&#8217;s barely anything that makes me feel like that.”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Her Majesty, I wish for this man to get seized by the inquisition.”</p>\n<p>“Oh my, that would be problematic.”</p>\n<p>Lise glared at him like a child glares at its parents&#8217; enemies, and Eluria, who should have held her reins, let out a moderate chuckle.</p>\n<p>“Why are you looking at me like that? This is the first time we meet.”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;It is not. I was near Her Highness during your first audience.”</p>\n<p>Now that she mentioned it, Takumi remembered that a month before, when he stood in front of the queen, he noticed something silver moving behind the throne.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;So that was you, huh.”</p>\n<p>“That what? This is the worst. Seriously, not even being perceived is just the worst. I want to punish you here and now in the name of Filia.”</p>\n<p>“It&#8217;s not my fault if I couldn&#8217;t see you from there. You&#8217;re just too short.”</p>\n<p>“I am not. I will let you know that you are looking at the tallest among my peers.”</p>\n<p>“You are all still children, so what&#8217;s the difference?”</p>\n<p>“I-I am still the tallest!”</p>\n<p>She remarked annoyed, but the truth was that she wasn&#8217;t even 1.4 meters tall, and it was even more pointless to compare herself to other children her age.</p>\n<p>“Oh well, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll grow enough in the next ten years.”</p>\n<p>“I told you I am grown enough already! And stop patting me on the head or I will really call the inquisition, for Filia&#8217;s sake!”</p>\n<p>As he rubbed her head, Lise slapped his hand to push it away.<br />\nEluria, who was watching them carefully, opened her mouth.</p>\n<p>“Forgive me, but I shall jump to her defense. I am sure that witnessing your exchange before, she now thinks that you are a bad person.”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;No, Your Highness. I believe that he is wicked.”</p>\n<p>She stated mercilessly, thrusting her index finger at him.</p>\n<p>“Not only he dared to negotiate with Her Majesty, who has the Goddess&#8217;s blood flowing in her veins, but also rudely conducted himself without apologizing! I can perceive the wickedness in his soul!”</p>\n<p>“Lise, you know quite a lot of difficult words for your age&#8230; You deserve praise.”</p>\n<p>“Y-Your Highness, why are you also treating me as a child&#8230;?”</p>\n<p>Feeling betrayed by her only ally, Lise started to shiver teary-eyed, and the queen warmly looked at her while repeating how cute she was.<br />\nMaybe Eluria was the real wicked one here.</p>\n<p>“Still, you cannot cry over something like this. I know very well how skilled you are, Lise.”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Really?”</p>\n<p>“Absolutely. So, stop crying, okay?”</p>\n<p>With a lovable smile, the queen wiped her saddened eyes.<br />\nThen, after reaffirming how cute the archbishop was with a somewhat excited expression, the other two started to ignore her behaviour.</p>\n<p>“Well, I&#8217;m glad that you recognize other people&#8217;s worth. There&#8217;s a lot of guys who can be used if you consider their abilities alone.”</p>\n<p>“I agree. In fact, you are one of them, and I am prepared to recognize you only to benefit from your efforts.”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;I see. But I&#8217;m a slave merchant, so I might accept any job outside my area of expertise only after some consultation.”</p>\n<p>“That is right&#8230; let me assign you something fitting, then.”</p>\n<p>She carefully peered at him while wearing a smile that implied something troublesome, giving Takumi a strong feeling of deja-vu&#8230;</p>\n<p>“Please, do not bother Her Highness.”</p>\n<p>A frowning Lise started to hit the slave merchant&#8217;s side, but he just shrugged his shoulders.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Fine. You won&#8217;t mind if I go back now, right? It&#8217;s my chance to gather more contacts among nobles.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I will see you there. Lise, can you accompany him again to the buffet?”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;I do not feel like it, but I will follow your order&#8230;”</p>\n<p>With dissatisfied words, the girl bowed and grabbed Takumi&#8217;s hand before leaving the garden behind.<br />\nAt first, none of them tried to start a conversation as they walked on the marble in silence, but Lise was the first to break the ice.</p>\n<p>“Sheesh&#8230; I do not understand what Her Majesty saw into you.”</p>\n<p>“She told you before, did she not? I have talent.”</p>\n<p>“This is not about your talent, but your luck. You got your contacts with the guards by sheer luck. The big companies were misbehaving, and you happened to find a solution&#8230; I cannot think of it as talent or ability.”</p>\n<p>She was firmly convinced of her words. It looked like she didn&#8217;t want to recognize Takumi, who was now dejectedly shaking his head in denial.</p>\n<p>“I had some expectations given your role, but I guess you&#8217;re still a child.”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;You are the worst. I will not turn a blind eye to any other attempt at treating me like a child.”</p>\n<p>“The worst is that you stopped using your brain. The very concept of luck is something believed only by lazy people who shut their brain down. It&#8217;s not a word that can be used so easily.”</p>\n<p>She turned her head to look at his face.</p>\n<p>“What do you mean with that?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, can&#8217;t you get that? Let me show you with a game, then.”</p>\n<p>He took a silver coin from his breast pocket.</p>\n<p>“Let&#8217;s try to flip this coin. If I get the right answer before it falls, would you believe that to be a mere fluke?”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Can I guess that one side is not heavier than the other, so there is not the chance of it being counterfeit?”</p>\n<p>“Nice guess. Rest assured, this coin is perfectly balanced, so I won&#8217;t trick you.”</p>\n<p>“Then you will guess the answer out of luck.”</p>\n<p>“Let&#8217;s see. Try to flip it yourself.”</p>\n<p>She stopped walking and took the coin from his hand with a puzzled expression, then adjusted it on her finger.<br />\nA clink rang from the flick of her thumb, and as soon as the coin started to spin in the air&#8230;</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Tail.”</p>\n<p>“Eh?”</p>\n<p>She heard his words clearly, and when the coin fell on her palm, it was exactly as Takumi said.</p>\n<p>“I won. Do you think I was lucky?”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Of course. It was only a coincidence.”</p>\n<p>“And if I told you I just predicted it?”</p>\n<p>A smile brimming with confidence formed on his face.</p>\n<p>“I took into account the strength you put into the flick, the number of spins, the time it would have taken to land, the surface it was going to hit, and I guessed the right answer. Do you think all of this is simple luck?”</p>\n<p>“It is&#8230; not possible to do any of that. This does not count! You tricked me!”</p>\n<p>Unable to stomach that outcome, she started to pull his clothes while protesting.</p>\n<p>“No, I just considered the primary factors and calculated what was gonna happen. If you label it as fortune, it means that you stopped using your brain.”</p>\n<p>She looked up at him only to see his face in profile.</p>\n<p>“What people call ‘luck’ can be disassembled into analyzing and guessing, but you are now denying that. So, did you become archbishop for a fluke?”</p>\n<p>“No&#8230;! I studied hard and earned my role!”</p>\n<p>“Don&#8217;t label everything as luck, then. Everyone put effort and hard work in what they do, so it&#8217;s not right to shrug it off as simply ‘luck’.”</p>\n<p>The despondent girl hung her head in shame, and Takumi stroke her hair lightly.</p>\n<p>“Do you get it now?”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Yes. I said too much. Sorry.”</p>\n<p>“Don&#8217;t worry. Let me tell you a little secret.”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;A secret?”</p>\n<p>She cocked her head, and he smiled from ear to ear.</p>\n<p>“What you just heard was a bunch of nonsense. I got it right by sheer luck.”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Can I punch you really hard?”</p>\n<p>“I think I&#8217;m understanding the queen better now. Teasing kids is fun.”</p>\n<p>“You are the worst! And stop treating me like a child, for Filia&#8217;s sake!”</p>\n<p>He mischievously whistled while she hit him repeatedly on the side.<br />\nThen, her hands stopped all of a sudden.</p>\n<p>“So, are you really just lucky?”</p>\n<p>As she lowered her voice almost to a whisper, her gaze turned to meet his.</p>\n<p>“Let me apply your words to myself. I am lucky to be born, and I am by growing up into a noble family and being chosen by a rich person too. My ability is no exception&#8230; so is all of this blessed fortune or just misfortune?”</p>\n<p>She enquired in a plain tone, and Takumi, seeing through her questions, snorted loudly as if he was bored.</p>\n<p>“Sorry, I would never give up or doubt myself, so I never thought about any of that.”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;I see.”</p>\n<p>She hung her head again for a few moments, then rose it again.</p>\n<p>“That was somewhat interesting.”</p>\n<p>“Nice. I&#8217;ll tease you again when I get the chance, then.”</p>\n<p>“Not that part. I will call the inquisition if you dare to tease me ever again.”</p>\n<p>She sharply glared at him, who wore a wry smile and turned to see outside, only to find that no one was there anymore.<br />\nHe felt that something had changed in the air, as it grew darker and heavier.<br />\nThen, a scream thundered in the air.</p>\n<p>“Give it a rest!”</p>\n<p>The next moment, a voice echoed in the castle.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/newgame-chapter22/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/newgame/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/newgame-chapter24/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1758\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"267df6e37b\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1758\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">4+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"New Game &#8211; Chapter 23","featured_media":{"id":"f7196a99-3aa6-576c-bfdc-d3a4aafea738","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/newgame-banner.png"},"categories":[{"id":"711623f2-28a0-57e3-9ad6-85a46264a357","name":"A New Game from the Depths of Captivity!"}],"excerpt":"<p>The ashen-colored birdie – Part 3 The inner part of [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-chapter23"}}}
