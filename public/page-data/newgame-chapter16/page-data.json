Even a wagon could fit in it, and it was paved with the same stones that connected the roads of Listina, so it wasn&#8217;t painful for the hoof of horses.<br />\nNowadays, since the city was working to make the water flow into a new drainage channel, the former one was abandoned and used to transport goods in secret, since no water remained.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Uff&#8230; they&#8217;re late!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Complained Kunon, who sat on a rock while flailing her legs under the moonlight.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Have some patience. They haven’t used Valeria’s route, and this is the only access to the underground pathway.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For the past two weeks, Takumi investigated it.<br />\nHe made sure that there weren&#8217;t other paths, secret doors or tunnels that lead outside.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Elsa has already started the operation, so they should come soon.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Takumi peered into the darkness lightened by starlight.<br />\nThen, Kunon&#8217;s ears twitched and she stood up, and he quietly imitated her.<br />\nA wagon covered by a cloth was approaching them from the shadows. After a few moments it started to slow down and its horses neighed.<br />\nThe coachman was a fat man.<br />\nSeeing who was waiting for him, his lips curved into a wicked smile.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“What a surprise, Mister Takumi. What brings you here at this hour?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I came to bother you, naturally. Sorry, but you&#8217;re going to hand over your wagon and leave.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Heh&#8230; You actually sounded like a bandit, but they act in large numbers.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The man glared at the two who were blocking his path.<br />\nThere was no one other than them.<br />\nThe guards were working in the slums, and Valeria&#8217;s members had other tasks to do elsewhere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Quality over quantity. Kunon alone is enough to seize the likes of you. By the way&#8230; you don&#8217;t really have time for small talks, right?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Yes, indeed. I must take care of an important deal.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Takumi laughed loudly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Geiz, you don&#8217;t have a single slave with you right now, do you?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The man&#8217;s smile vanished from his face.<br />\nOn the other hand, the young slave merchant, expecting his reaction, smiled brightly before opening his mouth again.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Our very existence is a pain to you, so you want to get rid of us to fully satisfy your grudge.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">He glanced at the wagon&#8217;s cloth.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Maybe you&#8217;re hiding a bunch of mercenaries in there to kill us. Maybe your sponsors abandoned you like a dog?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“What an imaginative brat you are.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I&#8217;m not imagining a thing. I know you pretty well.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Takumi started to tap on his temple while speaking.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“A coward like you would never ride a wagon alone, since you know that you might be attacked by someone. You need to play it safe, and paying mercenaries to protect you would do the trick.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">His finger stopped and moved to point at the coachman.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Here, I just explained your poor reasoning. At least I&#8217;m not afraid of being surrounded by a bunch of bandits, you coward.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Takumi sneered at him.<br />\nThen, Geiz goggled his eyes and screamed.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Kill them! Crush these bastards!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The cloth that covered the wagon fluttered in the wind and the moonlight showed what was hiding underneath.<br />\nKunon dashed toward Takumi, took him and jumped away.<br />\nThe next instant, a huge pillar of fire ascended from that spot and cut through the night with a thunderous roar which kept reverberating in the night as its flames were fueled by oxygen.<br />\nIt was a rare sight, but something like that was entirely possible in this world.<br />\nMagic.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“You knew my intentions, huh? I already know that.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">While flames burned toward the sky, a smile spread on Geiz&#8217;s face.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I knew that you would have approached me directly, so I got ready to kill you!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Shadows emerged from the interior of the wagon.<br />\nThey were all humanoids, but clearly none of them was human.<br />\nDemi-humans, and at least twenty of them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“The Hound is a real pain. Normal humans can&#8217;t even scratch her, and demi-humans are too soft to harm others&#8230; that&#8217;s why I thoroughly trained them only for this moment.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Their eyes shone with insanity, as if they were a bunch of starving beasts&#8217;.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I see&#8230; but they look hastily made. You drugged them and rewrote their nature forcefully, huh?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I had access to lots of drugs since I became part of the major companies. Demi-humans are just a bunch of brainless beasts anyway. Isn&#8217;t it better to use them like this?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Wearing a scornful smile, Geiz looked at them with contempt.<br />\nSeeing that, Takumi&#8217;s face twisted.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“&#8230;Jeez, that&#8217;s so like me. How vexing.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">He manipulated demi-humans with drugs and also brought several magic casters, who were still hiding in the wagon, with him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“He even brought magic practitioners&#8230; seems like he really wants to kill us, right, Kunon?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Uuh&#8230; I don&#8217;t really get magic because no one usually fights casters&#8230;”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">She let go of Takumi while glaring at the wagon.<br />\nOnly nobles or people related to them could learn magic.<br />\nThe Richtert family was particularly known for their powerful magic, and since they didn&#8217;t want their researches to be spread outside, they taught it only to their descendants.<br />\nStudying so diligently brought the various noble families to develop unique technology and acquire enough knowledge to manifest the true power of magic.<br />\nRichtert&#8217;s magic users were a privileged class, and one of them could wipe an entire army by itself. That&#8217;s why everyone hesitated to go against them.<br />\nStill, nobles were permitted to use magic only when strictly necessary.<br />\nThe pillar of fire that was cast from the wagon was weaker than a Richtert&#8217;s caster&#8217;s, so they were probably hired from another country.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“What are you gonna do? If this is too hard, we can run.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Oh no, that&#8217;d be super boring.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For Kunon, not even magic users were a threat.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“This is a rare chance, I should enjoy it to the fullest!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Unable to keep a straight face, she smiled and giggled while unsheathing her two daggers.<br />\nThe blades were jet-black and curved like a wolf&#8217;s claws.<br />\nAs she held her falcatas, Kunon smiled innocently.<sup><a class=\"sdfootnoteanc\" href=\"#sdfootnote1sym\" name=\"sdfootnote1anc\">1</a></sup></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Well then&#8230; Show me what you can do, guys.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Kunon&#8217;s smile was terrifying, but the demi-humans ignored it and attacked her from every direction.<br />\nTheir physical abilities were far superior that of a human and the effects of the drugs amplified them even further, granting them a speed that exceeded even the average demi-human.<br />\nA wolf-man&#8217;s fangs, an ogre&#8217;s sturdy arms, a dragon-man&#8217;s and a bird-man&#8217;s claws swooped on her little body to tear it apart.<br />\nStill, she remained immobile.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“That&#8217;s no good, you have to think before attacking&#8230;”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">She rotated her daggers smoothly, and with that, the four attackers fell on the ground like a bunch of puppets whose threads were severed.<br />\nShe then made eye contact with the others while smiling cheerfully.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Killing an enemy is hard, so you better think about what you do. How strong he is, where you should aim, striking it down with a single hit would be better than feinting&#8230; If you try to use only brute force, the enemy won’t even be scared of you.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">She was wearing her usual expression while spinning her weapons.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“There&#8217;s an abyss between someone who thinks and someone who doesn&#8217;t. Also, when you believe that someone is ‘invincible’, the abyss grows deeper.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">None of the fallen demi-humans had fatal wounds on them.<br />\nShe simply incapacitated them using her combat techniques.<br />\nShe made the wolf-men, who had a sharp olfaction, smell the poison that covered her blades the moment she unsheathed them.<br />\nShe aimed for the ogres’ weak points with her fists to damage their internal organs and bypass their tough bodies.<br />\nShe assaulted the dragon-men, who had sturdy scales protecting them, with enough power to harm them.<br />\nShe hit the bird-men’s temples with the flat of her blades to mess with their sense of balance and let them crash on the ground, rendering their claws useless.<br />\nOnce you know the enemy’s characteristics, it&#8217;s easy to find their weakness.<br />\nKunon was thinking about it that very moment.<br />\nWhenever she talked or ate something, a part of her was analyzing how to strike her opponents down.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Don&#8217;t worry, I won&#8217;t kill you. I&#8217;m a Hound, so my duty is to hunt and seize my prey.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The proof of her words laid at her feet. None of those guys was dead. She just made sure they&#8217;d be powerless.<br />\nThat reality was way more terrifying than thinking they were all slaughtered.<br />\nShe then shifted her gaze to the magic users who were chanting a spell, and when another pillar of fire was about to raise from beneath her feet, she stomped with all of her might.<br />\nThe ground broke under the blow with a loud crack, and the flames dispersed in a moment.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Uhm&#8230; is that all&#8230;? Magic isn&#8217;t that fun&#8230;”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">She pouted, deeply disappointed.<br />\nNormally, that magic would have burned any human to a crisp in a few seconds, but she suppressed it with sheer strength.<br />\nShe didn&#8217;t only look like a monster&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“How boring. Let&#8217;s finish this.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">She <em>was</em> a monster.<br />\nThe other demi-humans dashed past her in a panic and aimed at Takumi.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Nice move! You used your brain, huh? Still, that&#8217;s no good.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">She anticipated them and started to knock them unconscious.<br />\nTaking advantage of those few moments, the casters started to chant a spell aimed at Takumi, but the Hound tossed her black blades toward their necks.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Aiming only at Takumi is not fair~! I understand you&#8217;re afraid, but trying to escape me won&#8217;t help you!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">When she hit her targets, she pulled the threads fastened to her weapons back with a dissatisfied groan.<br />\nThe casters weren&#8217;t listening to her anymore.<br />\nTheir companions looked at them expecting their death, but their head wasn&#8217;t detached from their bodies, and neither was their windpipe severed.<br />\nThey were trying to talk, but not a sound escaped their lips.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Did you think I was going to kill you? I just cut your vocal cords.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Her expression clouded slightly.<br />\nDoing something like that while fighting was almost impossible.<br />\nIf the blade was to cut an inch deeper, they would’ve died for sure.<br />\nStill, she polished her abilities that much to make her foes think that she was unbeatable.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Your career as casters is over&#8230; but I&#8217;m sure my master will find a workplace even for mutes like you.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Beneath the veil of innocence of her voice, they could perceive her insanity.<br />\nIt wasn&#8217;t a matter of killing or not. That wasn&#8217;t even a battle to begin with.<br />\nShe was the embodiment of massacre itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Let&#8217;s see&#8230; One, two, three&#8230; every demi-human fainted, so those in the wagon are the only ones left, right?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Spinning her body, she showed them an inappropriate, bright smile.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“You have no chance, but&#8230; wanna try?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">She crushed their spirit. There wasn&#8217;t room for choice.<br />\nThey surrendered. It wasn&#8217;t to protect their life alone, but also to maintain a bit of sanity.<br />\nThey rose their hands while descending from the carriage and walked slowly toward Takumi and the Hound.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Nice job, Kunon. You handled this perfectly.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“It isn&#8217;t nice at all. You said this was hard, but it was just too easy. I&#8217;m sad now.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Well, I thought casters would have given you a hard time, but you&#8217;re really strong. You should be happy about that.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I&#8217;m not, you liar! I won&#8217;t listen to a word you say from now on!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I see. I guess you wouldn’t want to grab a bite after we go back home, then.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“&#8230;Sorry, I take it back.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A bitter smile formed on his face while she sagged her ears and tail, and the next moment, he started to pat her head.<br />\nSeeing him treat that relentless monster like that made Takumi look like a demon in the eyes of the casters.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Listen, Kunon, someone from Valeria should come here in a bit, so I need you to keep an eye on these guys.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Yes sir! But are you going somewhere?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">She tilted her head puzzled, and he sighed deeply.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I&#8217;ll chase that disgusting pig who fled as soon as you started to knock these guys down. Jeez, that fatso does the right moves only in these situations.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Then let me come&#8230;”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“You don&#8217;t need to. Just wait here, okay?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">He waved his hand slightly and headed toward the same direction of Geiz.<br />\nHis figure disappeared in the night.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><a class=\"sdfootnotesym\" href=\"#sdfootnote1anc\" name=\"sdfootnote1sym\">1</a> Kunon&#8217;s falcatas (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcata\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcata</a>) aren&#8217;t that big, as you can see from <a href=\"http://st.cdjapan.co.jp/pictures/l/14/38/NEOBK-2156801.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this picture</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/newgame-chapter15/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/newgame/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/newgame-chapter17/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1366\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"4707d01ff1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1366\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">2+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"New Game &#8211; Chapter 16","featured_media":{"id":"f7196a99-3aa6-576c-bfdc-d3a4aafea738","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/newgame-banner.png"},"categories":[{"id":"711623f2-28a0-57e3-9ad6-85a46264a357","name":"A New Game from the Depths of Captivity!"}],"excerpt":"<p>Slave merchant and slave merchant – Part 1 Two weeks [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-chapter16"}}}
