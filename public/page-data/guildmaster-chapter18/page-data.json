The three of us are members of the party that defeated the Demon Lord. If you want, we can bring him here in secrecy and free you from your oath.”<br />\n“I see&#8230; You are Sweet disaster, Voiceless requiem and the Charming goddess of wrath, huh?”<br />\n“Hahaha~! We&#8217;re well known!”</p>\n<p>Hearing her title, Aileen blushed. Indeed, she was charming even in her battle attire, but it seemed like she didn&#8217;t think the same.</p>\n<p>Mylarka didn&#8217;t mention my name to preserve my fake identity. Beatrice might have seen that I visited this mansion as Dick Silver to prepare lodgings&#8230; but since undead are weaker during daytime, maybe that wasn&#8217;t the case.</p>\n<p>“If you let Yuma create one of her barriers, she can seal your power so that you won&#8217;t attract any ghosts. That way, even though the Stollen don&#8217;t live here anymore, you can live with someone&#8230; Sebas also wants this.”<br />\n“It is as Lady Mylarka says. If you allow us, we would like to use this mansion as lodging for customers.”</p>\n<p>Beatrice looked surprised and didn&#8217;t reply for a while.</p>\n<p>Tears welled in her eyes and fell down silently. Despite her incorporeal nature, they were real.</p>\n<p>She had to keep waiting for those who abandoned her forever.<br />\nI couldn&#8217;t even imagine how she was feeling or how lonely she was.</p>\n<p>“Do you&#8230; really want to do this for someone who only caused troubles to people?”</p>\n<p>Yuma stepped forward and stood in front of her. A purifying aura enveloped her body any time, but the wraith queen wasn&#8217;t going to be in danger.</p>\n<p>“I understood how much you craved to see your master again. It is still not time for your soul to be called to Heaven.”<br />\n“Ah&#8230; Aaah&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>Beatrice fell on her knees, hands hiding her face, as the raging feelings she suppressed for so long assaulted her. The other girl kneeled and hugged her.<br />\nA bishop comforting a wraith queen&#8230; Seeing such a rare scene made me believe that bringing here Yuma had been the right choice.<br />\nHow could I&#8217;ve known that within these walls was hidden such a secret?<br />\nEven the reason behind the presence of ghosts was beyond my expectations.</p>\n<p>Beatrice cried for a while, and after she managed to calm down, she stood on her feet again.</p>\n<p>“Forgive me for showing you such a shameful appearance. It was not my intention to cry in front of you&#8230;”<br />\n“Crying consumes your magical power, doesn&#8217;t it? Are you okay? Ya look paler.”<br />\n“I know that I am in no position to ask you this, but might you lend me some energy? I am afraid that next dawn will be my last.”</p>\n<p>Mylarka hated that feeling, Aileen said it was friggin&#8217; cold, and draining Yuma’s holy power directly might have been fatal for her.</p>\n<p>I was the only choice&#8230; or rather, Aileen could do it too, but she was already looking at me with her thumb up.</p>\n<p>“Sebas can even use Healing Magic, he has a lotta energy. I guess it wouldn&#8217;t hurt him to lend you some.”<br />\n“As fellow girls, I&#8217;d love to lend you mine but&#8230; sorry, I hate that cold feeling.”<br />\n“I appreciate the thought. May I have some of Mister Sebas&#8217;s energy, if he agrees?”</p>\n<p>It meant that she would have just touched me, right?<br />\nThat wasn&#8217;t a problem, I could recover that small amount in a single day.</p>\n<p>“Yes, feel free to help yourself.”<br />\n“&#8230;I will see you later, then. I shall prepare.”</p>\n<p>Her figure started to fade as I was wondering what she meant.</p>\n<p>“Great, case closed. I&#8217;ll go to bed.”<br />\n“Girls, wanna chat in our room? Now that Yuma is better and all&#8230;”<br />\n“Yes, I would love to. Sebas, take care of Beatrice.”</p>\n<p>They left the attic and headed back to their lodgings.<br />\nI looked around and saw only a desk, bookshelves and a lantern.<br />\nI guessed that undead didn&#8217;t need to sleep. I then closed the door and started to follow the girls.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">◆◇◆</p>\n<p>After I removed my mask and took a bath, I relaxed in my room.<br />\nThis long day was finally over. The only thing left to do was to let Beatrice take some of my energy.</p>\n<p>She would have shown up once she was prepared, but what did she mean? I drank some wine while thinking about it, then threw myself on the bed.</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t sense anyone else nearby.<br />\nSince the door was closed, I wondered if Beatrice would have entered from a wall, so I raised my body.</p>\n<p>Then, my mind went blank.<br />\nLit by the dim light of the lantern, Beatrice was standing in front of me while hugging her body shily.<br />\nShe wasn&#8217;t wearing her black dress anymore.<br />\nEven though her headdress was the same, her negligée was even thinner than Mylarka&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>“L-Lady Beatrice, what is with your clothes? If you don&#8217;t wear something over them&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>She smiled and squinted her eyes. Even though she could probably float, she stepped closer, and the moment she moved her arms away from her chest, I managed to see her body beneath the thin fabric. It had the same color as a human&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>“This is the first time I do this with a man, so&#8230; since you are a gentleman, Sebas&#8230; No, Guild Master, I thought that I, as a wraith queen, should be prepared properly.”</p>\n<p>She knew my real identity&#8230; I could stop pretending to be a butler, so I prepared for the worst and returned to my normal self.</p>\n<p>“So, you watched me from the start&#8230; and played along with that?”</p>\n<p>She smiled again and blushed at my change of tone. She was an undead, but seeing her warm gestures made me think that there was still a lot we didn’t know about them.</p>\n<p>“I knew that you did not want the girls&#8230; or rather, Yuma, know about your real identity. The other two knew already who you are.”<br />\n“&#8230;I am the Guild Master of Silver Aquarius. Yuma wasn&#8217;t feeling well, so I wanted to help her from shadows.”<br />\n“I think she will find you out eventually. Do you not think she will be happy to know it?”<br />\n“I don’t want to&#8230; but you&#8217;re right. I want this place to serve as a recreation facility for my guild, and I want to invite Yuma again in the future&#8230; It would be weird to act as a butler when she is around, so I&#8217;ll have to tell her the truth sooner or later.”<br />\n“It would be a waste to never see you as a masked butler again. It suits you very much.”</p>\n<p>As she said that, she picked up the mask I put on the bedside table and tried to wear it&#8230;<br />\nIt was like she toying with me.</p>\n<p>After she returned it to its place, she walked toward me, and then held out her hand.</p>\n<p>“Still&#8230; I will not get tired to see you without it.”<br />\n“I don&#8217;t think so. My comrades are way prettier than me.”<br />\n“Everyone is interested in someone. For example, I like your face, Dick.”<br />\n“I was thinking about how you will drain my energy&#8230; You won&#8217;t act like a succubus, right?”</p>\n<p>She didn&#8217;t reply as she got closer, then her hands descended on my nightclothes and started to unfasten the buttons.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Mind to answer my question?”<br />\n“I will only touch you for today. You will not feel any pain, but&#8230; if I use only my palms, it will take quite a long time&#8230;”<br />\n“I-I mean, there&#8217;s a lot of things you can touch, but&#8230; are you sure? We just met.”</p>\n<p>I was starting to imagine what she was going to do.<br />\nShe was already at my third button when she touched the ribbon on her chest.<br />\nIf she pulled it, I would have probably seen her naked.</p>\n<p>“Even though I am a wraith queen, spending each night of the last ten years alone in a mansion where ghosts gather made me feel lonely&#8230;”<br />\n“&#8230;I see. I have no choice, then.”</p>\n<p>At that moment, I understood my stupid error.<br />\nI thought that since she hadn&#8217;t a tangible body, she wouldn’t have wanted to sleep with me, but I was soon proven wrong.</p>\n<p>Now it was too late.<br />\nI already gave her permission to help herself, and I couldn&#8217;t take it back.</p>\n<p>She untied the ribbon with a smooth movement. Her negligee opened and revealed her white, almost transparent body, which was now almost completely bare.</p>\n<p>“I would like you to share your energy with me all night. Since we do not have a hidden agenda, the others will not think badly of this.”</p>\n<p>She said nonchalantly and then raised her hands to remove her headdress.</p>\n<p>“Y-You don&#8217;t have to take that off now. Let&#8217;s do it later, in case.”<br />\n“&#8230;Alright. If this is what you want, Master Dick&#8230;”</p>\n<p>How could she call me with such respect after I had just told her that in such a pleading tone?</p>\n<p>When a man feels that the other party will listen to everything he says, there&#8217;s no way to stop him. I was no exception, but thinking about the three girls who were sleeping under this same roof allowed me to barely keep my sense of duty.</p>\n<p>“We&#8217;re just going to sleep together, right? And you&#8217;ll just drain my energy, right?”<br />\n“Yes. I only need to touch you a little, but another step might be necessary&#8230;”<br />\n“&#8230;Are we really gonna do it? Just kidding. It&#8217;s not like I can&#8217;t&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>The moment I tried to joke to regain some composure, she slid her fingers behind my neck.</p>\n<p>“Did you just do that?”</p>\n<p>She nodded and brought her fingers to her mouth.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/puu.sh/AinPD/3c9fe01409.png?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>“Mhhh&#8230; Sweet. But this will not be enough to sustain my body&#8230;”<br />\n“I see&#8230; we can&#8217;t help it. Take as much as you need.”<br />\n“Do not worry, we still have plenty of time before dawn.”<br />\n“B-Before dawn&#8230;? Isn&#8217;t that a bit too much?”</p>\n<p>She didn&#8217;t reply, even though it was an important matter.<br />\nThis time, her hands moved from my neck to my collarbone and started to unfasten more buttons.</p>\n<p>“I knew it from the start, even if you hid it under your clothes&#8230; You have the most polished body among your comrades&#8230;”<br />\n“I&#8217;m just a drunkard, I neglect my health, and I even stopped training.”</p>\n<p>Even if I enjoyed the pleasant feeling of being tipsy, I always eliminated the alcohol toxins, so I didn&#8217;t have a beer belly, but my daily work wasn&#8217;t enough to forge my body like this.</p>\n<p>Usually, I cast Support Magic on myself so that my muscles could always be in good conditions, even when I was sitting idly at the counter. For someone like me who tended to find everything bothersome, taking the chance to learn Support Magic when I was still a child was a gift from heaven.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Do I have to strip naked?”<br />\n“The more our body touch, the less it will take&#8230;”</p>\n<p>Since saying ‘For real?!’ might have been rude, I decided to say no more.<br />\nShe bent over and climbed over me.<br />\nEven though she could pass through objects, I could clearly feel her touch&#8230; It was warm. Maybe it felt cold only when undead drained energy by force.<br />\nI could almost feel her heartbeat, and something soft, pretty much the size of a hand, pressed onto my chest. She almost looked human.</p>\n<p>“So, wraith queens have tangible bodies&#8230; there&#8217;s a lot to know about you.”<br />\n“When I recharge my magic power, I can keep this form. I am sure you think the undead do not have warm bodies, but it is possible to tune our temperature like this&#8230; Master Dick, you are so warm&#8230;”<br />\n“Couldn&#8217;t you say that to Mylarka? She hates that cold feeling.”<br />\n“&#8230;What is your relationship with her? You should have deepened your bond as fellow party members but&#8230; you did not look very close.”<br />\n“I&#8217;ll get mad if you stick your nose where it doesn&#8217;t belong. And well, we&#8217;re just friends&#8230; w-why do you look so happy?”<br />\n“Eheh&#8230; that is a private matter, so I will keep it a secret.”</p>\n<p>I wanted to help the young lady who didn&#8217;t wish to be summoned, the one who was bound to this mansion and was now covering me with her body, but I wondered how things turned that way.<br />\nWhile I rummaged my mind in search of an answer, I prayed for the distant dawn to break that endless night soon.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/guildmaster-chapter17/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/guildmaster/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/guildmaster-chapter19/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1502\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"eb921bd60f\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1502\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">12+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"Guild Master &#8211; Chapter 18","featured_media":{"id":"cdff1161-96fa-5aea-b3f3-f7e09589d9fd","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/guild-master-banner.png"},"categories":[{"id":"b4b11328-5f15-59d4-aa4c-61da5eedadce","name":"After defeating the Demon Lord, he became Guild Master"}],"excerpt":"<p>TL note: sorry, I mistook (again) a couple of things [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"guildmaster-chapter18"}}}
