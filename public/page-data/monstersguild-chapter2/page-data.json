In the sky!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Then, a huge shadow blackened the sky.<br />\n<i>A cloud passing by?<br />\n</i>But when they looked at the sky, their hopes were brutally betrayed.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The figure of a huge, winged and horned reptile was blocking the sunlight.<br />\nIn its eyes sparkled the vivid glimmer of intelligence.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“A-A dragon…”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Every soldier started murmuring the same words.<br />\nThat was indeed the shape of a dragon, the most powerful and feared beast in the entire world.<br />\nThe unstoppable predator that struck fear in the hearts of its preys.<br />\nFacing one meant that it was impossible to avoid death, even if they tried to flee.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The soldiers, preparing for their death, unconsciously fell on their bottom.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Excuse me! Could you let us enter the city?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">That voice was so clear that it was totally out of place.<br />\nBut it was salvation for the soldiers.<br />\nThey immediately started searching for the source of the voice, but no matter how hard they tried, it was nowhere to be seen.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I’m up here!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">That mysterious voice came from the sky.<br />\nIt looked like the absolute epitome of death, who would make everyone tremble in fear, was speaking.<br />\nThe soldiers kept their eyes peeled.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Hello! Can you let us in?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Then, they saw someone on the dragon’s back.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“He’s riding it?!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The soldiers were horribly shocked.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"CENTER\">◆</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I-I see, so you’re a tamer…”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Beside him, there was a white horse with a horn sprouting from its forehead.<br />\nThe soldiers escorting Raiz stayed at a safe distance from him, and the people occasionally sent curious gazes at the peculiar couple.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Raiz asked the guards if they could show him the way to the city mayor’s house.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Yes. We couldn’t find a job since the end of the war, so we decided to open a shop. That’s why we’ve come here.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“A shop…? For the dragon?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The soldiers didn’t have any idea of the kind of shop a dragon tamer would open, so they started imagining the beast selling goods like a shop assistant.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><i>No, this can’t be.</i></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“We mainly want a home.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I see… Okay, we’ve arrived.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The soldier pointed his finger at a house that stood out slightly more than others.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Thank you for escorting us here.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Y-You’re welcome… We’ll go back to our positions.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">They seemed to flee as they got back to the walls.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Good grief, did they really leave us alone like this?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The astonished unicorn sighed looking at them.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Well, they’re just common soldiers, people whose duty is to protect their positions.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Raiz’s words were soaked in cynicism as he knocked at the mayor’s door.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"CENTER\">◆</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Hello, I’m the mayor of this town. My name is Dapta.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">They were brought to a large room, probably made specifically for receiving guests.<br />\nRaiz sat on a chair placed on the other side of the table that divided him from the mayor, a chubby man</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Hello, I’m Raiz Tamer.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“So, Sir Raiz, what brings you in my city? Bringing a dragon…”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">While terrified at the beast that could be seen outside the window, the mayor tried to probe Raiz intentions.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Well…”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Raiz gave a sidelong glance at the sturdy man near the mayor before starting to negotiate.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Oh, right! This adventurer is Trow, this city’s Guild Master. He also collaborates to maintain public order!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The mayor happily tried to change topic.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Feel free to call me Trow, noble Raiz.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Trow thought that Raiz was a noble of some sorts, since he introduced himself using his full name, and decided to point it out.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“No, my last name is just a title given to me during the war. I’m the first of my generation.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In this world, titles relative to battle merits are rare. They are mainly for honor.<br />\nPeople who overworked themselves are attributed titles rather than rewarded with money.<br />\nThat’s the reason part of the army’s wages are so low.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">That isn’t actually true in the long run, but this is another topic.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“So, why are you here?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Trow took over the discussion, but Raiz maintained the calm and continued the negotiations.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“You can guess from the dragon that I’m a tamer.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“A tamer?!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Squealed the mayor.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Tamers were nothing unusual, but someone who tamed a dragon was in a completely different class.<br />\nThat’s because to tame a beast of that level, one would need un unyielding spirit and incredible talent.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><i>Why is someone this amazing here</i>, thought the mayor.<br />\nTrow as well started to get tense.<br />\n<i>He tamed a dragon and even acquired a title… If my guess is right, he’s surely…!</i></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Actually, I’d like to know if you have any building in the city left for me and my monsters to manage.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“…What?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The request was so unexpected that the two of them were completely flabbergasted.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter1/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/monstersguild/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter3/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n</div><div class=\"fusion-clearfix\"></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div></div></div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" ><div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1227\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"c1aa47c9b8\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1227\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">1+</span>\t\t\t</div></div>\n\t","title":"Monsters&#8217; Guild &#8211; Chapter 2","featured_media":{"id":"0d92c2f4-93f0-5f5c-96b4-1f4f6b5bd939","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/monsters-guild-banner-1.png"},"categories":[{"id":"30e10852-d86d-5f1d-b35d-f45bf02d53e9","name":"Welcome to the Monsters Guild!"}],"excerpt":"<p>1+</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"monstersguild-chapter2"}}}
