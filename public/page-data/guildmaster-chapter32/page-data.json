Mylarka went to stop Jean Vinceburg&#8217;s escape, and I went to his castle.</p>\n<p>In the middle of the broad courtyard in front of the mansion was unfolding a sad scene.</p>\n<p>Kirsch and several other servants sat on the ground, their hands tied behind their back, and two men holding executioner&#8217;s swords were standing behind them.</p>\n<p>In front of them, a bald old man wearing luxurious clothes was glaring down at the girl&#8217;s comrades with a gaze colder than ice and a crooked smile on his face.</p>\n<p>“Exactly like Velvechia&#8217;s army, you betrayed Vinceburg&#8217;s family. It’s your fault it ended like this. Kirsch, I thought you were a loyal servant of Jean, but you are actually a disgusting backstabber.”<br />\n“Grrr&#8230;!<br />\n“Oh, don&#8217;t you dare to move, otherwise your head will roll on the floor. Let me give you one last chance. My foolish son has already left, so would you consider becoming my servant? If you swear loyalty to me, I shall grant your survival.”<br />\n“P-Please, wait, Lord Zevias! Does that mean that we–oof!”</p>\n<p>One of the other servants tried to talk, but one of the executioners kicked him hard, leaving him gasping and writhing on the ground.</p>\n<p>“Who said you could talk? I hold out my hand only to people who deserve it. The likes of you are replaceable.”<br />\n“What&#8230;?! If I hadn&#8217;t told you that Captain Kirsch didn&#8217;t follow your orders, you&#8230;”<br />\n“You didn&#8217;t stop her, so what is your point? Do you think betrayers should be treated kindly? How shameless of you.”<br />\n“Ugh&#8230; Shiiit&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>Kirsch was going to defend her comrade. I knew what was bound to happen in that case, so I started to think.</p>\n<p>How could I save her?<br />\nZevias&#8217;s executioners were A-rank adventurers, and one of them was surely good with his sword, so if he swung it down on Kirsch, she would lose her life for sure&#8230; still, beating them wasn&#8217;t hard.</p>\n<p>They had no escape&#8230; I had to make them focus on me.</p>\n<p><em>No matter how things turn out, I just hope that geezer dies of fright.</em></p>\n<p>I used some Support Magic on the servants to protect their bodies, just in case.</p>\n<p>At first, buffs weren&#8217;t something that could be earned through food, that was an expedient I thought about. Normal Support Magic was used on the battlefield to help one&#8217;s comrades.</p>\n<p>I hid my magic power and cast a strengthening spell on Kirsch, but that alone couldn&#8217;t do the work. The enemy must be weakened&#8230; so I started preparing for the next move.</p>\n<p>I trained a lot to use it, and despite it being less effective than Mylarka&#8217;s spells, the results are guaranteed.</p>\n<p>Kirsch lifted her head and looked at Zevias&#8217;s face. She had probably opposed resistance before she got seized. Blood was dripping from her lips like she&#8217;d been punched, and her hair was disheveled.</p>\n<p>“I can&#8217;t think I did anything wrong, Zevias Vinceburg! Even if I die now, someone will surely come to know what you did!”</p>\n<p>She didn&#8217;t spare him a word.<br />\nThere was no need to.</p>\n<p>Verlaine said that if Kirsch believed in her choice, we&#8217;d have accepted her as a reward.<br />\nWe had a deal, so we had to fulfill her request.</p>\n<p>Zevias was silent, but fury welled within him. With his next words, he would’ve ordered the executioner to end her life. His wrinkled face twitched sadly, reflecting for a moment the same feeling as Lang for that beautiful woman.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;As heartbroken as I am, you are accused of betrayal. Hence, I sentence you to death. I know you understand my choice.”<br />\n“Khh&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>As tears streamed down her cheeks, the light in her eyes never flickered, and not for a moment she bent her head.</p>\n<p>The shining blade that was reflected in her eyes slowly rose in the sky, and when it was about to swing down on her, I cast two spells simultaneously.</p>\n<p><em>Spirit Rising! Spirit Reduce!</em></p>\n<p>“Ugh&#8230;?!”</p>\n<p>The executioner stopped moving, and unable to keep the sword in his hands, he lost his balance and fell on the ground.</p>\n<p>“T-The sword is&#8230; heavy&#8230;!”<br />\n“What are you doing?! I told you to kill her! If you refuse to do that, Glance, you do it!”<br />\n“Only villains would sentence somebody to death, don&#8217;t you think?”</p>\n<p>That was the best moment to move. Before approaching the tied servants, I unsheathed my sword.</p>\n<p>It had been a long time since I last crossed my sword with someone, but that couldn’t even be considered a fight for me.</p>\n<p>“Who do you think you are with that mask, a hero&#8230;? That&#8217;s bullshit!”<br />\n“I&#8217;m just working like you, Glance Bardot of the Purple Scorpio.”<br />\n“Oh, is that so? Then, die!”</p>\n<p>He was an A rank adventurer with a score of ten thousand points, and I was sure that he earned a lot of money thanks to his strong arms and sword techniques.</p>\n<p>Still, anyone using a common sword against me–buffed and wielding a spirit blade–was simply asking to die.</p>\n<p><em>Clang</em>, our swords clashed, and his was beautifully cut in half.</p>\n<p>“Impossible&#8230;! A steel sword can&#8217;t cut through kurogane&#8230;!”<br />\n“Oh, you were using one of Velvechia&#8217;s weapons? I guess it was defective&#8230;”<br />\n“Grrr&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>Having lost his weapon, I kicked him to swiftly end our battle.</p>\n<p><em>Shoot rising.</em></p>\n<p>Normally there wasn&#8217;t need to use Support Magic, but I wasn&#8217;t obliged to go easy on him either, so I got carried away a little.</p>\n<p>Glance crashed on a big tree, and cracks formed on its trunk on the impact.</p>\n<p>“Who&#8217;s next? No one else? Geezer, your face&#8217;s turning purple.”<br />\n“S-Surrounded by a bunch of useless people&#8230;! If I could get out&#8230; If only I could get out of this&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>The man who manipulated his underlings from the shadows didn&#8217;t have any hint of cleverness on his face.<br />\nEven his very son abandoned him, and with this development, his hope crumbled down&#8230; but gripping at it with his everything, he grabbed his sword and pointed it at me.<br />\nHis visage was warped with haughtiness and hatred.</p>\n<p>“WAAAH!”</p>\n<p>Losing his mind, he screamed like a beast and swung his sword. Although I almost pitied him, considering he was even weaker than a C-rank adventurer, I didn&#8217;t let my guard down.</p>\n<p>Between the countless ways to approach a problem, I always chose the ‘non-traditional’ one on purpose. I&#8217;ve always fought like that.</p>\n<p>Hence, I hid my magic square.</p>\n<p>Whenever I saw Mylarka casting magic, I always wondered if she could do that.</p>\n<p>There wasn&#8217;t someone who could use Space Expanding Magic other than her, but I kept analyzing her since forever, and that was why none other than a jack of all trades like me could have somewhat reproduced it.</p>\n<p><em>Restricted area annihilation n°66 – Disintegration field.</em></p>\n<p>His sword apparently stabbed me.</p>\n<p>“S-See?! This is not the end for me! I will&#8230;”<br />\n“No, this is the end. And you won&#8217;t ever have another chance.”<br />\n“Whaaah!? W-What on earth&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>The sword started to turn black like a lump of charcoal, then crumbled in pieces. He fell on his butt and looked at me like I was a monster.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/i.imgur.com/UzBxT50.png?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>“M-My sword&#8230;! Y-You are a spirit! Are filthy spirits going to invade our capital?!”<br />\n“Don&#8217;t look down on them, Zevias. I know spirits way prouder than you. Not like that word applies on someone who tried to sell hiw own country&#8230; It would just be wasted on the likes of you!”<br />\n“Guhhh&#8230; Gh&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>As he accepted defeat, he started foaming, preventing him from articulating words properly, and in the end he fainted.<br />\nNone of his underlings wanted to fight anymore. Spirit reduce weakened the targets so much that if they hadn&#8217;t a certain amount of strength left, they couldn&#8217;t even hold a sword.</p>\n<p>“I guess that taking him away with you would be too much to ask, so just seize him.”</p>\n<p>No one said anything, but I didn&#8217;t feel anyone was against my proposal.</p>\n<p>I freed Kirsch and her comrades and after seeing that the rope had dug in her arms and she was bleeding, I cast Healing light on the presents.</p>\n<p>“This light&#8230; you can even use Healing Magic&#8230;?”<br />\n“I-I didn&#8217;t do anything wrong! Captain Kirsch did–”</p>\n<p>I hit the girl&#8217;s comrade and made him faint.</p>\n<p>“Has someone else betrayed you?”<br />\n“&#8230;No, although some wanted to. But that&#8217;s my fault, I am not worth of respect&#8230;”<br />\n“I don&#8217;t think s–”<br />\n“Forgive me, Captain Kirsch, for doubting about you even for a second&#8230;”</p>\n<p>Three of her subordinates started to talk apologetically, but she smiled at them.</p>\n<p>“Everyone would have doubted me there. Also, it might have actually saved you&#8230; but I&#8217;d rather die than be his servant.”<br />\n“Captain&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>She surely thought dearly of them. They trusted each other, but that trust was slowly soiled by the dirty job that Jean and Zevias ordered them to do.</p>\n<p>Charlotte crossed the sky followed by the fire dragon, so I guessed that Mylarka had completed her mission.</p>\n<p>“S-Sorry, masked man&#8230; Why did you save us?”</p>\n<p>Both my appearance and voice were camouflaged, so Kirsch didn&#8217;t recognize me, and as she waited for an answer&#8230; I was too focused on her skin, exposed from her ripped jacket.</p>\n<p>“Ah, f-forgive me&#8230; I did not expect someone to help us&#8230;”<br />\n“Nah, don&#8217;t worry. It was the least I could do.”</p>\n<p>I turned my back and started to walk away. My next move was contacting my guild members and make them deal with Kirsch and her comrades, since they probably had valuable information&#8230; and in the worst-case scenario, I had to ask Cody for some other help.</p>\n<p>“P-Please, tell me at least your name!”<br />\n“My name? You will forget me anyway, so it&#8217;s fine if you never know it.”</p>\n<p>That wasn&#8217;t a complete lie. I didn&#8217;t want to tell my name in front of others and did it only on very special occasions.</p>\n<p>Should I have answered her myself? Or was it better for her to ask my guild members? Both ways, knowing my name was useless, since there wasn&#8217;t any need to introduce oneself to a drunkard like me.</p>\n<p>It was exactly for that reason that I was wearing a mask.</p>\n<p>“I&#8217;m the fifth masked savior. Feel free to remember this.”<br />\n“Y-Yes! I sure will! Thank you very much, Forgotten hero!”<br />\n“Gh&#8230;?!”<br />\n“Hero&#8230;? That man?”<br />\n“He saved us, so shouldn&#8217;t I call him a hero?”</p>\n<p>They all agreed, but that shocked me.</p>\n<p>Did she know? No, she probably searched for Silver mug&#8217;s guild master&#8217;s name, which was officially recorded… everyone would connect the dots.</p>\n<p>Silver mug, or rather, <em>I</em>, accepted her request, and a masked savior came to help her&#8230; well, kicking up a fuss over a trivial thing like this was simply dumb.</p>\n<p><em>She will keep this secret. And if she doesn&#8217;t, I will make Verlaine add that as another part of our reward.</em></p>\n<p>The masked saviors were the product of a collaboration between people, not between guilds, and served to protect the country.<br />\nIf they saved someone, it wasn&#8217;t merit of any guild or company&#8230; I really wanted to make that thing clear.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/guildmaster-chapter31/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/guildmaster/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/guildmaster-chapter33/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1904\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"3d9219f2e8\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1904\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">4+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"Guild Master &#8211; Chapter 32","featured_media":{"id":"cdff1161-96fa-5aea-b3f3-f7e09589d9fd","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/guild-master-banner.png"},"categories":[{"id":"b4b11328-5f15-59d4-aa4c-61da5eedadce","name":"After defeating the Demon Lord, he became Guild Master"}],"excerpt":"<p>The once again Forgotten fifth Once we landed with the [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"guildmaster-chapter32"}}}
