How lucky to get another chance!”</p>\n<p>A humanoid shape appeared from the void scene and spoke with an inappropriate voice.</p>\n<p>“How much did you last? Around seven years?”</p>\n<p>Her behavior remained, but that was to be expected from an existence like that.</p>\n<p>“It&#8217;s been a while, Goddess.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, if I could choose, I&#8217;d never meet you again&#8230;”</p>\n<p>Her smile cramped, but after sighing, she quickly recomposed herself.</p>\n<p>“I can&#8217;t believe you survived for that long&#8230; with that cheeky behavior of yours, I thought you were going to die in a jiffy. I even wished for it.”</p>\n<p>“Are you really a Goddess?”</p>\n<p>“That&#8217;s rude, of course I am! A middle-ranked one, at least.”</p>\n<p>She answered while puffing her abundant chest with pride. Takumi sighed and glared at her stupid reaction.</p>\n<p>“Okay, I guess&#8230; Listen, do you understand that you didn&#8217;t grant my wish as I asked?”</p>\n<p>“Eh? Didn&#8217;t you want to reincarnate as a slave of some harsh world while keeping your abilities and look?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, you did exactly what I wanted, but&#8230; you forgot about a detail and added something, didn&#8217;t you?”</p>\n<p>His gaze was as sharp as a blade. She shrugged her shoulders and let her long, platinum hair sway behind her.</p>\n<p>“Oops, you found me out?”</p>\n<p>“Of course. Even an idiot could’ve connected the dots.”</p>\n<p>Replied him while remembering two girls.<br />\nKunon, a blonde, lively wolf-girl with gold-colored eyes, and Karin, a gloomy elf with black, silky hair.<br />\nDemi-humans whose power transcended human&#8217;s, captured exactly when he was reincarnated.</p>\n<p>“There&#8217;s a limit to human&#8217;s luck. Why did you do that?”</p>\n<p>He pointed at her, who wore a shy expression.</p>\n<p>“I&#8230; thought it was bad if you died the moment you awakened&#8230; I&#8217;m a Goddess, after all&#8230;”</p>\n<p>“Remember what I said, senile Goddess.”</p>\n<p>“I&#8217;m not senile! I have this faint feeling of having been alive a long time ago, but I&#8217;m definitely not senile!”</p>\n<p>“Who cares about your mental condition, just tell me what your goal was.”</p>\n<p>Takumi lowered his voice, and she smiled.</p>\n<p>“Let me answer with a question. Why do you think we make people reincarnate?”</p>\n<p>“I have no idea.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, c&#8217;mon~! You&#8217;re pretty quick-witted&#8230; or rather, I might even say you were the smartest in your original world. You know the reason, don&#8217;t you?”</p>\n<p>She laughed, amused, but he didn&#8217;t answer.</p>\n<p>“Anyway, rest assured. You were reincarnated in the lowest social class of that world. Sorry for nudging you a little&#8230; Right, what about some power for this time?”</p>\n<p>“Sure, only if I can punch you to death.”</p>\n<p>“That would be a bit extreme, don&#8217;t you think?!”</p>\n<p>“You reap what you sow. I reincarnated only to test my own abilities.”</p>\n<p>He couldn&#8217;t use them to their fullest in his original world, so his regret brought him to wish for an environment where he was free to use them as he wished.</p>\n<p>“Still, without those two you would’ve died, no? C&#8217;mon, show some gratitude to this concerned Goddess.”</p>\n<p>“Try to intervene again and I won&#8217;t just promise to beat you, retarded Goddess.”</p>\n<p>“Did those sound like words of gratitude to you?!”</p>\n<p>“Also, if I was alone, with my limbs tied and ignorant of the world&#8217;s language, the result would have been the same. I&#8217;d have escaped and survived anyway.”</p>\n<p>“Eeeh? If that was true, it&#8217;d be really boring.”</p>\n<p>“Well, sorry for ruining your mood. Anyway, since last time I couldn&#8217;t dispel my regret, don&#8217;t help me at all from now on.”</p>\n<p>“Okay, fine&#8230; I won&#8217;t make it happen again, and neither will I help you in the future. Test your abilities as much as you want.”</p>\n<p>She eventually reached her limit and surrendered while drooping her shoulders.</p>\n<p>“I already understood that you&#8217;re way more talented than the average human, so I don&#8217;t mind letting you do whatever you want, since I will still achieve my goal.”</p>\n<p>“I don&#8217;t know or care about what you are scheming, as long as I&#8217;m free to do what I want. Anyway, I have a lot left to do, so bring me back, please.”</p>\n<p>“My duty is also finished. Now I have a headache because of you&#8230; There, go into that light and you will wake up.”</p>\n<p>“Okay. Call me if you want to have another headache.”</p>\n<p>As he started to walk toward his destination, her voice reached him again.</p>\n<p>“What do you think about that world?”</p>\n<p>Her tone was totally different from before, as it was now tinted with sadness.<br />\nTakumi turned to let her see his smiling face.</p>\n<p>“It&#8217;s not bad.”</p>\n<p>Hearing his answer, the Goddess smiled bashfully.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/i.imgur.com/k0k6TSl.png?w=1100&#038;ssl=1\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a style=\"text-align: center;\" href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/newgame-chapter19/\">&lt;Prev</a><span style=\"text-align: center;\"> | </span><a style=\"text-align: center;\" href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/newgame/\">Index</a><span style=\"text-align: center;\"> | </span><a style=\"text-align: center;\" href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/newgame-chapter21/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1627\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"202d3a9a07\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1627\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">2+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"New Game &#8211; Chapter 20","featured_media":{"id":"f7196a99-3aa6-576c-bfdc-d3a4aafea738","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/newgame-banner.png"},"categories":[{"id":"711623f2-28a0-57e3-9ad6-85a46264a357","name":"A New Game from the Depths of Captivity!"}],"excerpt":"<p>TL note: I added the various images in the previous [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-chapter20"}}}
