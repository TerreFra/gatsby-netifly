Killing bandits won’t bring us any substantial fortune. Could we hunt beasts on the mountains? No, no, that won’t work…”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Excuse me, Lord Raiz…”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Turning toward that crystal-clear voice, he saw his underlings.<br />\nThey were looking at him with worried expressions.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Ah, sorry, sorry. Food is important, you know.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Raiz aim was to achieve success, but he really cared about his companions.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He caressed the lamia, one of his subordinates.<br />\nIt’s said that they seduce men and drive them crazy, but they’re just gentle and sensitive creatures.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“No, it’s not that… I mean, we want to be useful too.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">She grabbed his hand and rose it to her chest pleading.<br />\nRaiz’s heart screamed to keep his fingers at bay.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Behind them, other creatures expressed their consent out loud.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I understand that you want to help, but not a single shop would hire us, since we’re useful only in war’s times…”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Raiz was dejected.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Monsters aren’t accepted by society, they were used only for one reason. They managed to work and live until now only because he was a tamer.<br />\nThinking of being able to find a normal occupation was inconceivable.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Then why don’t we start our own business?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Suggested a unicorn, another of his underlings.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Starting our own business?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The equine nodded.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Exactly. If you will be the manager, we can accept tasks that are not restricted to mere fights. For example, we could use my horn.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Raiz was enlightened by his words.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Right, Healing Magic!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">He nodded again.<br />\nIt seems that their horn is a panacea capable of purify even water.<br />\nBesides, unicorns are prodigies in using Healing Magic.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“So, it’s okay to use our powers outside war?! We could make a living as Lord Raiz manages the shop, isn’t it?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Affirmative.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I understand<b>. </b>If we use our abilities, we can still find a job!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Raiz looked at his companions who stared back at him.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><i>When there won’t be any bandit left, we’ll end up starving anyway, so why not give it a shot? We could make a huge profit!</i></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Then let’s start a business with all we have left!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Yeah!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">That’s how the strongest tamer started a business as jack of all trades.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/monstersguild/\">Index </a>| <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter2/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" ><div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1232\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"b5750ff6f7\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1232\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">0</span>\t\t\t</div></div>\n\t","title":"Monsters&#8217; Guild &#8211; Chapter 1","featured_media":{"id":"0d92c2f4-93f0-5f5c-96b4-1f4f6b5bd939","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/monsters-guild-banner-1.png"},"categories":[{"id":"30e10852-d86d-5f1d-b35d-f45bf02d53e9","name":"Welcome to the Monsters Guild!"}],"excerpt":"<p>Monsters out in the cold “Bloody hell, we have no [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"monstersguild-chapter1"}}}
