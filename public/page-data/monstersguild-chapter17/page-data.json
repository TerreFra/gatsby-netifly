You were once part of our army, so you should understand your role, don&#8217;t you?! This country needs a capable soldier like you to avoid another war!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">He quietly listened to her, but he already knew what she was going to say.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">He asked Cat Sith to keep observing them, after all.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">They would’ve tried to convince him to return to the army by saying that he would be rewarded adequately for his merits.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Sorry, but I&#8217;m busy this morning. I appreciate your efforts, though. Do you want to come to see me at work?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">If you came back, there would be no need&#8230;!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Lety, we shouldn&#8217;t hinder his work. Everyone has to work, so we would only cause problems to other people.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Merck properly admonished the flamboyant woman.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Right. If I don&#8217;t go to work, I&#8217;ll get sued for breaching the contract, and I’ll have to pay a huge amount of money.</span><span lang=\"en-GB\"> If the army is going to pay for me, then I&#8217;ll seriously think about your proposal. Keep in mind that, to regain the lost trust, the actual sum will grow several times the original amount.<b>”</b></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Several times?!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Her body stiffened as she tried to imagine how much that would have been.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I have to go now. Feel free to come with me, if you want.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Without waiting for their reply, Raiz left the hut.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Hey, wait! We haven&#8217;t&#8230;”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Why don&#8217;t we go to see what he’s going to do? Even though he doesn&#8217;t want to come back, he&#8217;s at least busy with something.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">&#8230;Fine.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Maybe she already foresaw the situation, so she quietly listened to her companion.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"CENTER\">◆</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">A-A cockatrice?!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">In front of them, the frightening monster that could petrify with its gaze was laying in its nest.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Those with a high magic resistance had nothing to worry about, but it posed a real threat to anyone else.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Lety and Merck couldn’t help but hide from it in a panic.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Don&#8217;t worry, her eyes are half-closed.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">So what?!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Both replied in a shocked tone.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Cockatrices can weaken their power by half-closing their eyes. It can&#8217;t petrify anyone right now, not even you guys.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The two soldiers tilted their heads, dumbfounded.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">The monster really had its eyes half-closed, as if it was glaring at them.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I didn&#8217;t know they could do that.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Neither did I. What a surprise.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Well, usually don&#8217;t do that intentionally.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz left the two behind and approached Cockatrice, then he slipped beneath her feathered belly.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">What are you doing?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Asked a surprised Lety.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s cozy in there.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Cockatrice&#8217;s plumage keeps you warm on cold days.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Lamia replied seriously to Merck&#8217;s joke.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Thinking about it, a mattress stuffed with its feathers must feel great.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">And then, she thought about a new business move.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Wouldn&#8217;t you need a huge one, though?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Asked Lety after seeing one of the enormous feathers scattered around.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">But why is Raiz under her right now?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Merck asked Lamia who pointed at the monster in front of them.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Look carefully. There&#8217;s only one reason.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">They faced that direction again only to see Raiz bringing a huge egg with him.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I see, you only wanted its egg.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Yes, but the crucial part starts now.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">The crucial part?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">They asked while wearing a quizzical expression, then, all of a sudden, a loud, strange roar pierced their ears.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">W-What?! What&#8217;s going on?!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz dashed away from there and passed by them at full speed.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Run! Cockatrice is going berserk!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">As Lamia warned them, she was already far away.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Eh&#8230;? Whaaat?!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Cackleee!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The monster unleashed another thunderous roar.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Waaah!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The two started to run for their lives.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Behind them, Cockatrice spread her wings and chased them.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I-It&#8217;s flying! It&#8217;s gonna swoop on us!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">No, it&#8217;s not flying, it&#8217;s gliding! Cockatrices are like chickens, they can&#8217;t fly!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Who caaares!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Behind them, a loud sound of flapping wings preceded each attack of the monster.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">The two soldiers were traumatized by that experience.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"CENTER\">◆</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Don&#8217;t worry, Cockatrice is not very smart. She will move around for a while, then she will forget about this and return to her nest.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz was carefully washing their loot in the hut.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Thank you, guys. You were a great decoy. Today&#8217;s catch went flawlessly.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">De&#8230;coy&#8230;?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Usually, we have to ask fast monsters to help, but you’re well trained.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Praised them Lamia cheerfully.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">&#8230;Kh!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Lety wanted to punch Raiz with all her strength, but she had no more energy after running around so much.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">We&#8217;re gonna sell this egg in town. Are you tired or do you want to tag along?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Asked Raiz, as he loaded the egg onto a wagon.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Lety immediately regained her energy and stood up.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Of course we&#8217;re coming!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I&#8217;ll take a break for now. Catch up with you later.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">On the other hand, Merck couldn’t move and was sprawled on the ground.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Okay, let&#8217;s go.”</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter16/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/monstersguild/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter18/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1323\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"d55b8023e8\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1323\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">4+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"Monsters&#8217; Guild &#8211; Chapter 17","featured_media":{"id":"0d92c2f4-93f0-5f5c-96b4-1f4f6b5bd939","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/monsters-guild-banner-1.png"},"categories":[{"id":"30e10852-d86d-5f1d-b35d-f45bf02d53e9","name":"Welcome to the Monsters Guild!"}],"excerpt":"<p>Raiz&#8217;s job &#8211; Ranch management “Raiz, today you&#8217;ll come back [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"monstersguild-chapter17"}}}
