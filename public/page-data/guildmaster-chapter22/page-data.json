Once she calmed down, the mood softened drastically.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“It&#8217;s a bit late for introductions, but my name is Kirsch Auguste. I&#8217;m really sorry about my rudeness.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">She had an estoc tied on her waist, so I guessed she was somewhat skilled in martial arts. Her score might have been around three thousand, so she was probably equal to a B-rank adventurer.<br />\nI&#8217;d say she was above the average servant of a noble family.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">People like her usually preferred to live freely, not tied to someone.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Sorry for coming this late.”<br />\n“Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m sure you had to work during the day, and you came now not to attract attention.”<br />\n“&#8230;Exactly. I&#8217;m an attendant of the noble Vinceburg family&#8230; We can now say that I&#8217;m a traitor, but&#8230; this time&#8230;”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The bar was closed, and me and Cody were listening from the kitchen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Are you sure? You have to work tomorrow, and this is a problem of my guild. Why are you that interested?”<br />\n“What are you talking about? If the duke is planning something, there might be something I can do! Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll respect your choices, so feel free to use me as you want!”<br />\n“Usually, the strongest doesn&#8217;t move before the end, though.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I complained, but he simply smiled at my cynical remark, so I didn&#8217;t say anything else. Cody brought his glass, which was still not empty, to his lips while listening to the girls talking at the counter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“So&#8230; what is Zevias Vinceburg planning?”<br />\n“Master Zevias let his son, Lord Jean, become head of the family. Still, I found out that he&#8217;s moving after a certain goal while keeping his family&#8217;s power.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I could imagine Kirsch&#8217;s expression simply by hearing just how agitated she was.<br />\nI wanted to compliment Cody for keeping his cool, but given his power, it was obvious that almost nothing could trouble him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“They&#8217;re trying to unite with the Republic of Velvechia to assault the national boundaries.”<br />\n“&#8230;They want to cause a revolt?”<br />\n“Yes&#8230; I’m aware that it might sound like nonsense, but I have the proof that confirms it. The duke and Velvechia kept exchanging letters about their treacherous plans, using a secret messenger who was assaulted and robbed of the last one by some thieves.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I honestly couldn&#8217;t say if that was good or bad, but if I wanted to maintain Albein&#8217;s peace, I guessed it was the latter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I joined the expedition team against the Demon Lord exactly because I didn&#8217;t want to live in a chaotic era. Maybe I could’ve lived doing what I wanted anyway, but I wanted people to not live in fear of being attacked daily by monsters. Also, I wanted a better life.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Have they threatened your master&#8217;s family?”<br />\n“Yes. However, the letter was written with an encrypted code, so the thieves had to torture the messenger, and that&#8217;s how they knew the connection between Vinceburg and Velvechia. I was ordered to be the head of a party to retrieve it, and&#8230;”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I understood that the orders were to not let escape any of the thieves, and although I wasn&#8217;t the kind of guy who jumped to conclusions, that development was just natural.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“&#8230;To kill them all, isn&#8217;t it?”<br />\n“&#8230;We had two orders. The first was to retrieve the letter, and the second&#8230; was to slaughter them right before the negotiations started.”<br />\n“Have you done it?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Kirsch hesitated before speaking in a trembling voice.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“&#8230;I couldn&#8217;t forgive them for threatening my Master. We fought, but we didn&#8217;t kill them all. Then, I had a bad feeling, so I used the see-through skill to read the letter without damaging the seal, even though it was an unforgivable act&#8230;”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Any thief guild taught see-through, which allowed the user to see through thin materials like paper. I could use another method, which had almost the same effect, so I didn&#8217;t need it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A thief guild was different from an adventurer&#8217;s. Learning any of the skills they taught was illegal, since there were always a lot of criminals among their members. The instructors weren&#8217;t exceptions, in fact it wasn’t rare for them to commit robbery or other crimes.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But Kirsch served Vinceburg, so she accepted the dirty work and obliterated the menace.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The thieves had to be punished, but she couldn&#8217;t avert her eyes from the situation.<br />\nShe came to us because she couldn’t shake away the feeling that something dangerous was going to happen.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Is the Republic of Velvechia trying to team up with Vinceburg to take this country&#8217;s properties?”<br />\n“&#8230;Yes. Lord Jean wanted to marry Princess Manarina quickly to gain influence in the royal family and then make demands using his newly acquired status&#8230;”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If he used Velvechia&#8217;s power, he could’ve obtained the throne. He would no longer need Manarina&#8217;s hand.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">If we didn&#8217;t stop him, Velvechia would have already attacked us&#8230; only thinking about it was unsettling. Humans will always be scarier than monsters.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“&#8230;Hey, Dick, it has been a while since last time I&#8217;ve seen you wear an expression like that.”<br />\n“What are you talking about? &#8230;Guess I can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s my drink&#8217;s fault, eh.”<br />\n“How long has been since I last felt my blood boil like this? I guess I keep coming here to not forget how it feels to be a hero.”<br />\n“Didn&#8217;t you say that, given your position, you shouldn&#8217;t be happy if the country was in danger?”<br />\n“Yes, I did. But if I can prevent it before anyone notices, it will be fine. You like when things are done this way, right?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Not drawing attention is the best. Nothing is a problem if it&#8217;s resolved before it becomes one.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In this case, the citizens didn&#8217;t know that a war was looming over the country.<br />\nIf we succeeded, they would’ve seen the Vinceburg family being deprived of their peerage and honor for an unknown reason, which meant that one of the three major noble family&#8217;s would’ve been replaced&#8230; if the King wanted it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I wish I could do things that way too&#8230; but my sword is way too flashy.”<br />\n“Yeah, but you&#8217;re the right person in the right place. It&#8217;s very likely that I&#8217;ll ask your help this time.”<br />\n“It is not sure, huh&#8230;? Well, I am looking forward to it.”<br />\n“Sorry, but you&#8217;re still the strongest. I won&#8217;t make you move easily.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Cody&#8217;s glass was now empty and his thirst quenched, but since I couldn&#8217;t heal him with magic, I handed over some Favor apricot to make him sleep soundly for the night.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“&#8230;Is this the same one you served to that girl?”<br />\n“It&#8217;s pretty effective on girls, but it works even on men. I tried it myself.”<br />\n“Nice. If you make Mylarka and the girls drink it&#8230; no, I guess calming them too much would not be good.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I mixed it with carbonated water and handed it over. That&#8217;s when our client&#8217;s story reached its climax.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Lady Kirsch, so you read the letter and confirmed that it should’ve been delivered to Velvechia and that it was about the marriage&#8217;s flop, am I correct?”<br />\n“Yes. Velvechia already prepared to raid this country in secret along with Master Zevias. They erected a fortress and defensive walls, now fully supplied for the invasion, in the plains that confine with us in the south, but that is only a bait. They plan to attack from the inaccessible mountains in the north, because even though that&#8217;s a natural barrier, the guards on that side aren&#8217;t much vigilant.”<br />\n“&#8230;If Velvechia knows a secret passage to pass from there, they will surely lead an army toward the capital. If the faction of Albein notices the attack, the capital won&#8217;t be the only battleground&#8230;”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Verlaine had a lot of experience in war, so she quickly grasped the flow of the situation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Vinceburg is in charge of defending that line&#8230; but if they help the enemy to invade&#8230;”<br />\n“You did a great job coming here, Lady Kirsch. If your masters were to find that you discussed it with a guild, you might have been arrested.”<br />\n“&#8230;Indeed. My subordinates kept quiet about my treason, but I wonder how long it will last&#8230; Master Zevias is really savage when it comes to failures. I might even get expelled for that&#8230;”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Her words came to a stop. I could feel her, since her life was so in danger that she came to ask us for help.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I understand that I shouldn’t feel like this and I shouldn’t have betrayed my lord in the first place, but&#8230;”<br />\n“If Lord Zevias&#8217;s plan succeeds, the citizens will suffer, so your determination is important. Silver Aquarius won&#8217;t allow or forgive anyone who dares to point their finger at you.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Who knows what Kirsch would’ve thought if she knew that Verlaine, who just said those righteous words, was the former Demon Lord&#8230; Did she remember the indignation of a vassal betraying its master?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Some parts of my body started to itch when I heard her say that our guild was a righteous one, and Cody started softly laughing while looking at me.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Then, Verlaine let our customer wait and entered the kitchen for a brief moment.<br />\nI nodded to her, and she smiled brightly before returning to the bar.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I couldn&#8217;t waver in front of this choice.<br />\nIf it was a matter of trading, there wouldn&#8217;t have been many problems, but an invasion aimed at the capital was a different matter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I just wanted to live in peace. Drinking every day, working, and laughing while talking nonsense with friends. Nothing more.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">What should I’ve done to keep things that way?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Of course, exactly what I&#8217;ve done so far.<br />\nCody was right. I should have prevented any disaster&#8230; and I would have to secretly move to let someone else, who could afford it, being the center of attention.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“&#8230;Have you made up your mind, Dick?”<br />\n“Yeah. I can&#8217;t let you join the masked saviors yet, but I&#8217;ll figure something out. Come back here tomorrow.”<br />\n“It is a promise. I will leave everything to you, since I am not good with complicated stuff.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">He also had that side&#8230; he was really enthusiast to defeat bad guys but wasn&#8217;t good at analyzing the situations. He liked clear and simple things.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">After accompanying him to the back door and seeing him off, I listened to the rest of the girl&#8217;s talk. They were at the part where Verlaine showed the contract and discussed our reward.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Given your request, it will be hard for you alone to arrange a reward for us&#8230; but let&#8217;s talk about it after we achieve this task and calculate a proper remuneration. This guild exists because Albein registered it as such, so, if we want to keep our license, the reward will likely present some implications.”<br />\n“B-But&#8230; is this something your guild alone should worry about&#8230;? Not the entire country&#8230;?”<br />\n“The success ratio of our guild, saving special cases which go against our customers&#8217; feelings, is a hundred percent, regardless of the requests&#8217; difficulty. It&#8217;s a shame that we can&#8217;t show it by our confidence alone, but let&#8217;s take a step further and say that we are the only ones who can do this. These are our conditions, if you want to officially submit your request to us.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Kirsch kept listening to Verlaine.<br />\nCould our guild achieve it&#8230; or rather, was there any guild who could? Thinking about it, even though she came so far, it was only obvious that she hadn&#8217;t much faith in our success, given how delicate the situation was.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">But well, we just had to show her the result she wanted.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I had to resolve it from the shadows before anyone noticed that something was going on, exactly as I already did many times before.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Hearing our conditions, Kirsch looked quite tense, but when she opened her mouth&#8230;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“&#8230;I will do whatever I can within the range of my possibilities, although I understand that it won’t be enough. Not even offering you my entire life and all my future reincarnations.”<br />\n“Life has no little value, although I won&#8217;t say that it has the maximum too. Still, if you, Lady Kirsch, have the pride to make such a choice, we will accept your life as a reward.”<br />\n“K-Kh&#8230; Ghhh&#8230;!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">What the hell was with those cute words? But I let Verlaine be.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I couldn&#8217;t define her as ‘great’, so I let her be the bartender, but&#8230; when she showed that side of her personality, I wondered who the real Guild Master was.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Kirsch started to cry. She then wiped her tears with the handkerchief that Verlaine offered her and rose her head.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Her face was now clear. She still looked unsure about accepting our conditions, but despite that, venting made her feel better.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Please&#8230; Stop the Vinceburg family and save this country.”<br />\n“It will be done, Lady Kirsch.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">She signed the contract, and the next day we would have started.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">There were a lot of problems to deal with.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Vinceburg knew how to pass through the country&#8217;s boundary, so I had to think of a solution&#8230; then, I had to prepare for a potential invasion from Velvechia and a way to slow their assault down.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Meanwhile, I had to confirm if Kirsch&#8217;s information regarding Zevias and Jean was accurate.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Also, my guild members had already a lot of work, so I could only ask the girls for help.<br />\nLastly, even though I didn&#8217;t want to leave the bar, there was the possibility I would also have had to move&#8230; While I was thinking about all of that, I erased my presence and saw Kirsch exiting from the back door.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/guildmaster-chapter21/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/guildmaster/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/guildmaster-chapter23/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1605\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"6c43ad2ff4\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1605\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">5+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"Guild Master &#8211; Chapter 22","featured_media":{"id":"cdff1161-96fa-5aea-b3f3-f7e09589d9fd","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/guild-master-banner.png"},"categories":[{"id":"b4b11328-5f15-59d4-aa4c-61da5eedadce","name":"After defeating the Demon Lord, he became Guild Master"}],"excerpt":"<p>The servant&#8217;s sorrow and the unwavering guild When the bar [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"guildmaster-chapter22"}}}
