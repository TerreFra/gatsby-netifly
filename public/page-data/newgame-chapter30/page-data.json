It’s evening right now.”</p>\n<p>Lize jumped at Takumi&#8217;s voice, not expecting him to be that close.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;This is the worst. Letting you see my sleeping face is just the worst.”</p>\n<p>“Try to think a bit more about yourself, then. No matter how much stressful work one has to do, a good child shouldn&#8217;t push all-nighters and just go to sleep early.”</p>\n<p>“I am no child&#8230; but I have surely been a problem. Sorry.”</p>\n<p>“No need to apologize. I&#8217;m in debt with you for teaching me about magic, so if you need help with anything, feel free to come to Suzuran.”</p>\n<p>“It was not that big of a deal&#8230; also, I do not&#8230; need anything.”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;I see. Keep doing your best, then.”</p>\n<p>Lise balled her hand firmly at his words.</p>\n<p>“My job isn&#8217;t that important&#8230;”</p>\n<p>As if to squeeze out her feelings, she uttered those words in a whisper.<br />\nBefore he could comment, the sound of heavy footsteps approaching them reached their ears, and they turned to see Mirta hurrying over.</p>\n<p>“Sorry for making you wait! Oh, Lise, are you awake?”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Yes. Sorry for falling asleep in the middle of our lesson.”</p>\n<p>“Do not worry! I came by a few minutes earlier, but you were still sound asleep on Takumi&#8217;s lap&#8230; I confess I was a bit envious.”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Did I sleep on this slave merchant&#8217;s lap?”</p>\n<p>As she stared at Suzuran&#8217;s leader in wonder, Takumi patted the said zone.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, I was reading this book while you rested your head here. It was bad when you started drooling, though.”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;No way. I do not drool.”</p>\n<p>“What&#8217;s that thing on the corner of your mouth, then?”</p>\n<p>She blushed furiously while scrubbing her mouth with her sleeve.</p>\n<p>“Guess I just imagined it, huh?</p>\n<p>“&#8230;People like you are the lowest of the low&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, who cares. At least you woke up, didn’t you?”</p>\n<p>Unable to stomach Takumi&#8217;s smile, Lise flailed her arms about while her face flushed a bright red and tears welled in her eyes, and the slave merchant decided to take a hold of himself.</p>\n<p>“By the way, one of Fairstadt&#8217;s messengers came to escort you home. Please, take this as a sign of gratitude for what you did for us today.”</p>\n<p>Mirta handed a basket over the archbishop.</p>\n<p>“What is this?”</p>\n<p>“An apple pie I just baked.”</p>\n<p>The child&#8217;s nose twitched as she smelled the sweet aroma coming from Mirta&#8217;s hands, and she looked at the basket with sparkling eyes, like it was a treasure.</p>\n<p>“Takumi told me that you wanted to taste my dessert, so I thought to give you some&#8230; do you perhaps dislike it?”</p>\n<p>“No, I like sweet things&#8230; but I am not used to this kind of things, so I am surprised.”</p>\n<p>Holding the basket close to her chest, like she was holding a precious gem, Lise bowed her head.</p>\n<p>“Thank you very much. I will take good care of it.”</p>\n<p>“Do not mention it. Still, although the pie&#8217;s flavor should be all right, the shape is a little bit off. Be careful not to wrinkle the paper when you lift it, okay?”</p>\n<p>Gazing at the woman&#8217;s wry smile, Lise&#8217;s mouth curved slightly.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Okay. I will be careful.”</p>\n<p>“I hope you like it! Let&#8217;s go now, the messenger is waiting at the door with a carriage.”</p>\n<p>Suzuran&#8217;s leader stretched her hand toward Lise, who was about to grab it, when&#8230;</p>\n<p>“No&#8230; I will be fine by myself. Thank you for worrying.”</p>\n<p>&#8230;after a nimble bow, she darted away.<br />\nWatching her back growing distant, Mirta let out a few whispered words.</p>\n<p>“Lise, will you&#8230;?”</p>\n<p>“I can&#8217;t promise that, but at least she shouldn&#8217;t be excessively abused. That piece of shit Kiad did it only to provoke us, and, in the past, she has probably been&#8230; but I don&#8217;t think it has been that bad since she became the archbishop.”</p>\n<p>Lise now had the chance to show herself in front of other nobles, so Fortesea couldn&#8217;t hurt her thoughtlessly, given that rumors could have spread and tarnished their fame. Kiad would never think that was fine.</p>\n<p>“Kiad is just a brute, that&#8217;s why he hit her. But he knows well what his actions could bring&#8230; At least, he knows he won&#8217;t just be spanked a little.”</p>\n<p>Then, Takumi grinned.</p>\n<p>“Still, the likes of him are easy to manipulate.”</p>\n<p>He tapped repeatedly on his temple.</p>\n<p>“Let&#8217;s go, we have some stuff to do. Tell Elsa we said hi.”</p>\n<p>“Okay&#8230; Takumi, take care of Lise.”</p>\n<p>As she looked at him with uneasiness, he turned his back and waved his hand, then told the others to come with him and headed to the slums.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/newgame-chapter29/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/newgame/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/newgame-chapter31/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1899\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"b94110ab7a\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1899\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">1+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"New Game &#8211; Chapter 30","featured_media":{"id":"f7196a99-3aa6-576c-bfdc-d3a4aafea738","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/newgame-banner.png"},"categories":[{"id":"711623f2-28a0-57e3-9ad6-85a46264a357","name":"A New Game from the Depths of Captivity!"}],"excerpt":"<p>The way to open up the cage – Part 3 [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-chapter30"}}}
