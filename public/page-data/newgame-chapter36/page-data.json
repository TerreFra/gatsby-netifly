The ceremonial sword tied to her hips reminded everyone of the official status of the match.</p>\n<p>“It has been&#8230; a wonderful match, Suzuran&#8217;s members.”</p>\n<p>After hearing her words, the three of them rose their heads.</p>\n<p>“Lord Elvis extolled your brave fight, and I can do nothing but agree with him and approve of his choice. Today, we will also hold the ceremony to baptize you winners as knights.”</p>\n<p>Takumi glanced at Elvis, who sat a few steps behind Eluria, but couldn&#8217;t read any concern on his face.</p>\n<p>“I am deeply delighted by the words Her Majesty has addressed to my subordinates. Their victory was blessed by our Goddess Filia, thus they should aim to become our Queen—Filia&#8217;s closest entity&#8217;s—sword.”</p>\n<p>“Eheheh&#8230; Hearing you mouthing wise words is hilarious&#8230;”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Your Highness, please, refrain from murmuring something in the middle of your talk.”</p>\n<p>“Why, are you in a bad mood, Lux?”</p>\n<p>“I am not. But whenever that slave merchant does the impossible, I receive a lot of exhortation, so my stomach is hurting a little.”</p>\n<p>Lux, who sat behind her, managed to smile despite the twitching of his cheek.<br />\nNearby him, an old man adjusted his glasses on his nose.</p>\n<p>“Ohohh&#8230; It looks like you are going to rack your brain, Lord Lux. That man you have set your eyes on is earning a title, so should you not be happier?”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;I am obliged for your observation, Lord Cramer. I envy how you avoid problems and hardly have to deal with any.”</p>\n<p>“Ohohh&#8230; Dealing with problems and discord is the way of doing of the harmonious Administer. Whenever we find a lull sea, we never know what boils deep within it.”</p>\n<p>Cramer Administer, the overlord who carried Richtert&#8217;s national politics on his shoulders as the prime minister and also controlled the cabinet ministers, replied to Lux&#8217;s cynicism while shaking his mustaches.<br />\nHe was a crafty man who acted to maintain harmony and stability in his country.</p>\n<p>“Forgive this old man for butting in your conversation, Your Highness. I am sorry.”</p>\n<p>“Well, you better be. We are in the middle of a public speech.”</p>\n<p>“Ohohh&#8230; I did not expect to be rebuked like this&#8230;”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Can any other unnecessary conversation stop now? None are worth these people&#8217;s time.”</p>\n<p>Maybe afraid that their talk would last too long, Elvis cut it down with a sharp voice, and pushed the Queen, who looked at him with a wry smile, to go on and face Takumi again.</p>\n<p>“Lord Lux will notify you with the details of the lands you will be put in charge of after your subordinates become knights. I also have a personal matter I want to discuss with you, slave merchant.”</p>\n<p>As Eluria mouthed those words, she exchanged looks with Lise, who was still standing behind the throne—her usual sour look plastered on her face.<br />\nThe child took a step toward Takumi while tightly pressing her lips together.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;I cannot believe you really won.”</p>\n<p>“I was hoping to hear ‘I believed in your victory’, though.”</p>\n<p>Hearing him joking around, she squeezed her staff tighter along with her lips.</p>\n<p>“I should not believe&#8230; that is why I gave up.”</p>\n<p>After crushing her personal beliefs, the only thing that was left for her was to obey.<br />\nShe gave up because she believed that she could&#8217;ve never won that fight.<br />\nIt couldn&#8217;t be helped—that justification was what helped her bear her current life.</p>\n<p>“Did you like the apple pie, Archbishop Lise Crest?”</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Yes. It was so delicious it made me feel better.”</p>\n<p>His simple question cleared her face from any shadow as she answered with a beaming cherubic smile.<br />\nTakumi nodded in satisfaction.</p>\n<p>“I heard Her Highness&#8217; words clearly. I will abide by Lord Lux&#8217;s details once I receive his notification.”</p>\n<p>“Look forward to it. Now&#8230; we cannot let people wait any more. As a boring ceremony, Let us hold it right away.”</p>\n<p>Saying so, Eluria stood up and unsheathed her sword, the symbol of the royal family—the blue of its blade was clearer than the sky&#8217;s and deeper than the sea&#8217;s—and lowered it on Kunon and Karin, as they both kept their heads bowed.</p>\n<p>“In the name of Eluria Richtert, your queen, I hereby grant you the title of knight. By the power vested on you, I ask your loyalty to my country.”</p>\n<p>The flat part of her sword touched their shoulders, and once the queen finished the ceremony, thus marking the official end of the match, Takumi&#8217;s comrades, silent until that moment, rose their heads again.<br />\nThe audience bursted in excited cheers for the last time that day.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/newgame-chapter35/\">Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/newgame/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/newgame-chapter37/\">Next</a></p>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" ><div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"2610\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"a6f7e531c7\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_2610\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">1+</span>\t\t\t</div></div>\n\t","title":"New Game &#8211; Chapter 36","featured_media":{"id":"f7196a99-3aa6-576c-bfdc-d3a4aafea738","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/newgame-banner.png"},"categories":[{"id":"711623f2-28a0-57e3-9ad6-85a46264a357","name":"A New Game from the Depths of Captivity!"}],"excerpt":"<p>The birdie&#8217;s tears &#8211; Part 4 Takumi and his comrades [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"newgame-chapter36"}}}
