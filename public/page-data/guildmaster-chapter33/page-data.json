The first to hear her was the prime minister, who tried to request an audience with the royal family before the country could be shaken by such a crisis.</p>\n<p>Despite its prestige, Vinceburg started to rotten since Zevias&#8217; generation, and it became evident even for other families. No matter their noble title, both Orlanz—the first ducal family—and Stollen deemed their trying to force a marriage with a princess outrageous, and none of them could stay silent in front of Jean&#8217;s debauchery.</p>\n<p>Stollen knew that their former mansion now belonged to my guild and had already sent me a friendly letter that stated their reciprocal trust with Orlanz, who took to heart Kirsch&#8217;s case and wanted to employ her.</p>\n<p>I believed that she could accept their request.<br />\nEven Yuma said she&#8217;d have helped her indirectly. I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;d have felt left behind if she was the only one in the expedition party who didn&#8217;t help in all this matter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">◆◇◆</p>\n<p>Vinceburg was about to be stripped of its status, but things settled down with a generous demotion to viscounts. This outcome was decided after the confirmation that not every member of the family was helping Jean and Zevias, since some didn&#8217;t even know what they were up to.</p>\n<p>Now that there was an empty spot to become a ducal family, the marquesses decided it was important to choose a new one. As the preparations took a long time before one was selected, the two remaining ducal families sat at the top for a while.</p>\n<p>Luckily, when Kirsch started to work for Orlanz, her ability and loyalty for her master and country had conquered them, so she was allowed to keep her remaining subordinates under her authority.<br />\nRegarding the reward, she decided to talk it over another day. We told her that we got what we wanted, but she didn&#8217;t accept it and insisted.</p>\n<p>And so, a week went by.</p>\n<p>I invited the other masked saviors to Beatrice&#8217;s mansion for dinner, and before sitting at the table, I told Yuma that she didn&#8217;t have to do anything for us this time, but she was adamant on contributing to the matter.</p>\n<p>“My way to help people who fight among each other is to lead to Heaven the souls of the dead who faced their demise in chagrin. Although such is one of us priests&#8217; duties, if this is what would make you happy, I will gladly make you worry about me.”<br />\n“Yuma&#8230; you sure have grown. You always said that you wanted to quell all souls.”<br />\n“Well, that is what I really want&#8230; but controlling myself brought you to help me, and even provided me a place to vent.”</p>\n<p>She smiled like only a holy maiden could do, but I perceived something immoral behind her words.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Did you vent a little as the masked priest?”<br />\n“Y-Yes&#8230; It has been really satisfying so far. Still, my dress suggested that I am part of the Holy Church of Albein despite my mask, so the offerings are increasing. But I cannot shake off my head what I felt when I purified the entire city&#8230; Ahh&#8230; I so want to touch your soul like that again&#8230;!”<br />\n“I-I see&#8230; feel free to do that whenever you want, as long as it’s only touching my soul.”</p>\n<p>She blinked her cute, round eyes repeatedly while I struggled to grasp the real meaning behind her words—but my effort was fruitless.</p>\n<p>“No. I will do it in your last moments, when your family will take care of an old you. Then, I will accompany you through the path to Heavens.”<br />\n“&#8230;A family, huh? I should choose a bride before that.”<br />\n“W-Well&#8230; y-yes. Let me inform you that my parents have high hopes for you, so&#8230; I-I might&#8230;”<br />\n“Mister Butler, Yuma, we&#8217;re waiting to take our seats for a while now. Have you done talking yet?”<br />\n“Kh! S-Sorry. Sir Butler, let us resume our talk another time&#8230;!”</p>\n<p>Hurrying over her seat, Yuma sat nearby Mylarka, who looked at me while thinking about something, then smiled and started chatting with her friend.</p>\n<p>“Dear guests, would you like a drink before dinner?”<br />\n“I&#8217;m fine with anything you suggest.”<br />\n“Me too! Yuma, you wanna some milk? Can&#8217;t break your taboo today, right?”<br />\n“Yes, anything but alcoholic drinks will be good for me.”<br />\n“I guess I will&#8230; have the usual, then.”</p>\n<p>The last one talking was Cody, who wore plain clothes and sat nearby Aileen.<br />\nHe almost asked me directly how he should dress, since he wasn&#8217;t the kind of person who cared about clothes, so I introduced him to a tailor I knew.</p>\n<p>I wondered if days like that would repeat in the future.</p>\n<p>In front of me were the few friends I could talk to sincerely. I didn&#8217;t want to lose them, but that was exactly why I wondered: was it better to keep denying what I saw?</p>\n<p>Would Cody forgive me if I told him&#8230; if I told <em>her</em> what I knew?</p>\n<p>Cordelia Blancneige was a name that appeared in the birth records of her hometown.</p>\n<p>Thanks to my information network, I didn&#8217;t even have to personally move to search for it. I never wanted to pry in my friends&#8217; circumstances, and that was the first time I heard about her birthplace.</p>\n<p>Although she kept her brown hair short, sometimes I noticed it was growing longer, and both in our journey and when we sat nearby drinking, I wondered if she really was a girl.</p>\n<p>When that happened, I always denied the truth: she couldn&#8217;t be a girl, and if I asked her directly, I would&#8217;ve lost her trust.</p>\n<p>Probably, what I wanted to do would’ve made her angry and tore our relationship apart.</p>\n<p>Still, until then I wanted her happiness to last as much as possible, even though she had to keep lying about herself. I wanted to make her relax.</p>\n<p>“Let me show you my gratitude for what you did by offering you a special dinner. Sir Cody, would you mind accepting a drink of my suggestion?”<br />\n“&#8230;? Yes, feel free to.”</p>\n<p>I felt my heart skipping a beat.<br />\nEven if I kept feigning ignorance while shrugging it off like a hallucination from an inebriated dream, our relationship wouldn&#8217;t change.</p>\n<p>I knew that it was wrong&#8230; it was the first time I was so afraid of something.<br />\nI was glad when Cody, a regular, dropped by my bar.</p>\n<p>No matter the gender, my feelings would’ve been the same.</p>\n<p>“If you will excuse me, I shall present you your drinks.”</p>\n<p>Beatrice entered the room while pushing a wagon, over which four glasses were filled with colorful liquid, one for each of our guests: red for Mylarka, blue for Aileen, white for Yuma, and yellow for Cody.</p>\n<p>“This is called Rainbow drops, an original blend of Silver Aquarius.”</p>\n<p>Those drinks changed their color into one of the rainbow&#8217;s when I added a drop of a special liquid. The original base is made of brandy, liqueur or fruit juice. It already tasted really good, but after I added that drop, the taste was greatly enhanced.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;Dick, is this&#8230;?”</p>\n<p>Cody called my name despite my butler&#8217;s appearance, as if he didn&#8217;t care about it.</p>\n<p>Without saying a word, I signaled Beatrice to place the glasses, filled with see-through, colored liquid, in front of them.</p>\n<p>I was sure that Cody would have ordered an ale, since I told her that was a common order for male guests, and that&#8217;s what she kept ordering.</p>\n<p>She probably didn&#8217;t want to look effeminate&#8230; but her choice was only half right.</p>\n<p>She was playing the part only to hide her real gender from me.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why I had to make her stop in a way that words couldn&#8217;t express.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;I mean, probably I worded it poorly, but I would not ask for anything other than rum or ale&#8230; with only a few exceptions.”<br />\n“This is no exception. I am sure I was not tricked by my imagination.”</p>\n<p>Mylarka, Yuma and Aileen&#8217;s faces twitched. They couldn&#8217;t believe me&#8230; but their reaction was normal.</p>\n<p>I pretended to be ignorant for five long years until this moment.</p>\n<p>Cody tried to say something, and a flash of anger lit her eyes, but&#8230;</p>\n<p>“&#8230;I must question you later. Know that this will cost you.”<br />\n“As you wish. Still, there was no error in my preparation. If it is not to your taste, I beg you to punish me at your discretion.”</p>\n<p>I bowed deeply while preparing myself for Cody to snap at me.</p>\n<p>But the only thing that leaked from her lips the next moment was a sigh.</p>\n<p>“&#8230;I will ask you what the meaning of this is later, since I am probably the one that needs to prepare.”</p>\n<p>As I raised my head, the four girls&#8217; gaze darted on me.<br />\nThey weren&#8217;t looking at me with blaming eyes, but understanding and perceptive ones.</p>\n<p>“Why did you choose today, and since when have you known it&#8230; I&#8217;d love to ask you a lot of things, but I will contain myself out of respect for Cody.”<br />\n“I am obliged, Lady Mylarka.”<br />\n“Eh? You wanna keep that butler facade? Dick, you&#8217;re just ashamed of talking honestly with Cody, ain&#8217;t you?”<br />\n“&#8230;Actually, I do not mind it, as I did not in the past, and I never will&#8230;”</p>\n<p>Hearing that, Cody flushed up to her ears.<br />\nI saw her blushing like that only when I asked her, during our expedition, to take a bath together.</p>\n<p>“Thing is that now you lost a male friend, Dick.”<br />\n“N-No? Feel free to treat me like a guy, otherwise&#8230; i-it will be a problem&#8230;”<br />\n“Guess you thought pretty much &#8217;bout it huh? Anyways, tonight we driiink~!”<br />\n“F-Forgive my rudeness. I appreciate your cordiality, Sir Butler, but alcohol is a bit too much for me&#8230;”<br />\n“Lady Yuma, although I prepared your drink like the others, yours is alcohol-free, so do not worry.”<br />\n“How thoughtful of my Master&#8230; despite being alcohol-free, you invented a way to create a flavor that emulates alcoholic drinks. I would love to know more of your recipes periodically&#8230;”</p>\n<p>Beatrice was now used to be this mansion&#8217;s landlord, but if she wanted to, I could drop by from time to time.</p>\n<p>Still, the four sat at the table stared daggers at her&#8230; her invitation was a subtle way to ask for magic power to preserve her physical form, which I had to provide. But I wouldn&#8217;t have done it each time I was here, and neither was she hoping for that.</p>\n<p>I felt Yuma and Cody, whose face was still red but preserved her usual smile, looking at me differently.</p>\n<p>“We should deal with the flames of jealousy from now on, are we not? This will be hard for everybody.”<br />\n“W-Well, we cannot help it. Dick is not self-conscious in the slightest.”<br />\n“That&#8217;s damn true. He&#8217;s the type you must bait, otherwise you can&#8217;t pull it. There&#8217;s some crazy fishing to do for him, huh?”<br />\n“Gh&#8230; I am only a masked butler&#8230;”<br />\n“And I am a masked priestess. If I should express it in a few words, I would be glad if you could look more after me.”</p>\n<p>Yuma dropped a bomb on me&#8230; but that made everyone smile.<br />\nShe&#8217;s always been like that, like she wasn&#8217;t part of this world, but her assertion proved the opposite.</p>\n<p>“Dick, do you remember our promise? You&#8217;re not getting away easily if you don&#8217;t.”<br />\n“Ah, so this job was done okay? Why next time don&#8217;t we all eat at my house? Feel free to bring Verlaine witcha.”<br />\n“Then, since you always postpone it&#8230; I want you to spar a little with me.”</p>\n<p>They all said what they wanted, and although I only wanted to drink at my bar, they didn&#8217;t seem to let me.</p>\n<p>“Anyhow, Dick&#8230; or rather, Sir Masked Butler, I beg you to start our toast.”<br />\n“Why are you all&#8230;? I mean, yes, I sure will. My dear guests, raise your glasses&#8230; cheers!”<br />\n“Cheers!”</p>\n<p>The members of the expedition party, which now became the masked saviors, rose their voices in unison.</p>\n<p>Nothing had changed from then.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t set an ending time for our party, so the girls had time to eat until they were stuffed, talk and appreciate each other for some time.</p>\n<p>The next day, I&#8217;d have been back to my normal life, so I really wanted to enjoy those peaceful moments.</p>\n<p>“Sir Butler, what is this drink?”<br />\n“Would you teach us how to prepare them? I always found unfair that you know how to do so many things.”<br />\n“Ya know, he teaches by making others watch him, so we better pay attention.”<br />\n“Uhm&#8230; I&#8217;m interested in seeing how to prepare this. Show me, Butler.”<br />\n“Well, if I may&#8230;”</p>\n<p>Beatrice grabbed the shaker and then passed it to me. It was a peculiar object that couldn&#8217;t be found in the capital&#8217;s bars, and also what I had used to prepare those drinks. I was deeply interested in how other countries prepared them, so I decided to buy one.</p>\n<p>I put into it the ingredients and started to shake, then poured the solution into a glass, enjoying the curious stares of my beloved friends who seemed to look at a sparkling treasure.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/guildmaster-chapter32/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/guildmaster/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/guildmaster-chapter34/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1915\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"7df3a6c462\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1915\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">11+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"Guild Master &#8211; Chapter 33","featured_media":{"id":"cdff1161-96fa-5aea-b3f3-f7e09589d9fd","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/guild-master-banner.png"},"categories":[{"id":"b4b11328-5f15-59d4-aa4c-61da5eedadce","name":"After defeating the Demon Lord, he became Guild Master"}],"excerpt":"<p>The peace&#8217;s restoration and the butler&#8217;s invitation Kirsch Auguste informed [&hellip;]</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"guildmaster-chapter33"}}}
