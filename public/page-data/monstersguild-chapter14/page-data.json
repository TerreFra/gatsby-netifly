He probably has combat experience.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Added Merck after examining the man.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">They decided to move the body beyond the hill so that the carpenters couldn’t see it.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Can’t he be a farmer or an adventurer?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">No, his muscles don’t match farmers’ builds. He would be more credible as an adventurers, but his equipment is something an assassin would wear.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">He took a black dagger and a little bottle filled with a hideous liquid from their clothes.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Black knives are used to avoid the reflection of light on the blade, and this is undoubtedly poison.<br />\n</span>He wasn’t hanging around your ranch to go after some villager or merchant.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Tension started to build up along with his words.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz! Just come back with us! We won’t know when it might be too late!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Lety tried to persuade him desperately, her face already pale.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Her reaction wasn’t something expected from a simple former co-worker.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">…I have to think about it. I still have some stuff I must take care of.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Who cares about it! Someone is trying to kill you!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">She insisted firmly, but he simply shut his eyes and ignored her.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Lety, don’t force him. He needs some time to think.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">But…!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I also want him to join the army again, but forcing him is no good.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">…Fine.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Even though she was so opposed until a moment before, Merck managed to calm her down.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz, we’ll bring this guy with us to the city. We’ll settle in some inn for a little while, so if you change your mind about our proposal, feel free to come. Of course, we will also come to check how things are doing here.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">We’ll come here every single day!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Lety was dead-set on convincing Raiz, but she had no choice but to give up for today.<br />\n</span>After informing the tamer, they finally left the ranch.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Lord Raiz, what will you do?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Lamia looked at his master with an anxious expression.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">The monsters didn’t trust the army that fired them, and some were even hostile to it.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Well, let’s see… I don’t want to return for now.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The presents let out a sigh of relief.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Anyway, where did he come from?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">He wondered out loud thoughtfully.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Maybe someone sent them from the Kingdom of Serga.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz nodded at Lamia’s guess.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Still, he didn’t seem to be satisfied.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">That might be possible.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Is there something that doesn’t feel right?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">No, I was just thinking about Merck and Lety’s proposal. Does the army really want me back?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">I don’t understand human’s wars, but I do understand that they would seek for powerful allies.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Lamia was a monster, but thanks to her half-human side, she had the intelligence and flexibility to understand humans.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">It would be great if people acted and moved by reason only…”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\"><i>Still, there are some parts of what they said that feel suspicious.</i></span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">He didn’t want to worry his subordinates even more, so he kept that thought for himself.<br />\n</span>The presents glanced at him one after the other, but even Lamia didn’t seem to notice anything.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Well, I don’t want to return to the army. We even started a serious business here! Also, I can’t leave this place until Dragon’s gear is fully paid!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Hearing the monsters chuckle, Raiz relaxed.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">Now that the war ended, he didn’t want to make his dear subordinates fight again.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">You’re right. Oh, and now that the carpenters are building us a new house, it would be a shame to leave it empty!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Indeed.”</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"CENTER\">◆</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Warmed by the light of a bonfire, Raiz looked up at the sky.<br />\n</span>It was a beautiful, cloudless evening.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">A meow reached his ears.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Are you back?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">He turned to face a lovely cat covered by a soft fur.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Cat Sith repurrting for duty.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The cat stood on his hind legs and climbed on Raiz’s lap.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Have you found out anything?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The monster faced Raiz and extended his paw without uttering a word.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">…”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">The tamer moved his hand without thinking and pressed on the cat’s squishy paw.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Purr~! Oh yes, a massage…! No, I mean, yessshhh!”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">He rose both his ears and tail while hissing.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Sorry, I was fooling around.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz then took some dried meat from a leather bag and handed it over.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Thank you, Meowster.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Cat Sith was different from the other monsters.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">He agreed to report useful information periodically in exchange for payment.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">There weren’t many monsters that acted like this, and tamers like Raiz were more inclined to use big monsters.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">So, do you have any information for me?”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">Raiz asked again while the monster bit its reward.<br />\n</span><span lang=\"en-GB\">He rose his paw slowly.</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“<span lang=\"en-GB\">Of course. I found out something amazing, Meowster.”</span></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><span lang=\"en-GB\">That was a long night for the tamer.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter13/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/monstersguild/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter15/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n</div><div class=\"fusion-clearfix\"></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div></div></div>\t\t</p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1188\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"a65f8ccfb3\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1188\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">2+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"Monsters&#8217; Guild &#8211; Chapter 14","featured_media":{"id":"0d92c2f4-93f0-5f5c-96b4-1f4f6b5bd939","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/monsters-guild-banner-1.png"},"categories":[{"id":"30e10852-d86d-5f1d-b35d-f45bf02d53e9","name":"Welcome to the Monsters Guild!"}],"excerpt":"<p>2+</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"monstersguild-chapter14"}}}
