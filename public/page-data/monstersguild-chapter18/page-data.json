I brought Cockatrice&#8217;s eggs~!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Raiz was knocking at the back door of an inn located in the main street of Dekuch.<br />\nAfter some clattering sounds, a chubby woman opened it.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I&#8217;ve been waiting for you~! Today there&#8217;s a lot of orders for them. If you were late, I&#8217;d have gone grabbing some myself.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Sorry, I always have a hard time when I collect these, but I&#8217;m glad I could make it in time. How many do you need?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Uhm&#8230; Three, please. The place is quite crowded.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Here, thank you!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Raiz unloaded the eggs from the wagon and handed them over.<br />\nAt first sight, he looked like a delivery guy from some animal husbandry, the only difference being that those eggs were ten times bigger than a chicken&#8217;s.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“You really came here to sell them&#8230; I didn&#8217;t expect an inn to buy them.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Yeah, this inn has the best cuisine when it comes to cockatrice&#8217;s eggs dishes. The owner of this place, who&#8217;s also a master chef, was pretty interested, so he tried to buy some and that attracted quite the number of customers, so now he’s a regular.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“It&#8217;s pretty rare to find someone who cooks them, you know? People are curious to know how they taste!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The woman brought the articles in the store nonchalantly, then exited again and handed over a leather bag.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Here. Make sure there&#8217;s everything.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">He took it and started to count the money.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“A silver coin and fifty copper coins. Nothing is missing.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">He pocketed his payment and returned the leather bag to the woman, who glanced at Lety.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“By the way, who&#8217;s that girl? She&#8217;s pretty and dressed nicely! Don&#8217;t tell me she&#8217;s&#8230;”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">She raised her pinky to allude to something.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The soldier tilted her head without understanding what she meant.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“She&#8217;s just an old colleague.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“How boring! A man shouldn’t be indecisive!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The woman started to slap him on the back with her hand.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Let&#8217;s talk about it when it happens.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“What are you saying?! Youth ends before you know! It&#8217;s now or never!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Hahaha, I&#8217;ll do it sooner or later.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“C’mon&#8230;”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Taken aback by his answer, she let her hand fall back to her side.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Well then, we&#8217;re off.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I’ll call you again when we run out of eggs!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Raiz kept waving his hand while returning to the wagon. When he looked at Lety’s face, she was looking angrily at him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“What&#8217;s up?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“A cockatrice&#8217;s egg for fifty copper coins?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Normally, ten chicken&#8217;s eggs were worth ten copper coins.<br />\nCockatrice&#8217;s eggs were ten times bigger than them, so their price should have raised accordingly, but Raiz was actually selling them at five times their hypothetical price.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Still, thinking about how dangerous was to collect them, fifty copper coins were ridiculously few.<br />\nThe one who laid them could turn people into stone, after all.<br />\nNot to mention how big and deadly were its claws and attacks.<br />\nRunning for your life only to gain fifty copper coins was crazy.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Well, Cockatrice isn&#8217;t too aggressive, and I know how to collect her eggs, so it isn&#8217;t that hard for me.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“But she attacks you anyway! If you make a wrong move, you might be seriously injured!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The memories of what happened before sent shivers down her spine.</p>\n<p>“Well, I want to strengthen my connections in the city.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“What do you mean&#8230;?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Didn’t you hear that woman? Now cockatrice&#8217;s eggs are a specialty of this city, and people love those kinds of things. Once that shop makes a name for itself, merchants and adventurers might start coming here only to taste them. The Dragon Express&#8217; last stop is here in Dekuch, so don&#8217;t you think people might use it to taste this rarity? And the brand, little by little, might extend to other shops around the city.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Raiz explained carefully why he priced them so cheaply.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“So, you&#8217;re trying to become someone necessary for this city?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">He nodded firmly.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Are you kidding?! Why are you wasting your time?! Isn&#8217;t returning to the army thousands of times better than this?! If it&#8217;s a matter of money, we can discuss it!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Raiz understood that she really wanted him again with them.<br />\nHe knew, thanks to Cat Sith&#8217;s information, that she only wanted the best for him.<br />\nStill, hearing it from someone else and from the person in question ware totally different things for him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>The only ones who didn&#8217;t treat me differently were Lety and Merck&#8230;</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">He remembered well when they first met.<br />\nNo one cared about the intimidating guy who used monsters as weapons.<br />\nThere were others like him, but, thanks to his powerful beasts, he was a step above even them.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Raiz knew very well that being too powerful had its downsides, but those two were exceptions. They didn&#8217;t care about his reputation and got closer to him anyway.<br />\nLety wanted to have a match with his dragon, and Merck acknowledged his monsters&#8217; strategic value.<br />\nThey ended up being very important comrades for him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“While we&#8217;re here, wanna see my monsters at work?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Eh?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Then, he pointed in front of them.<br />\nLety looked in that direction wondering what he was talking about.<br />\nThen, she saw a dressed humanoid bird, a kikimora.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Is that another of your monsters?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Yes, she is a great weaver. She is really good with her hands.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“A weaver? But isn&#8217;t it a monster?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">She was puzzled.<br />\nUsually monsters are dreadful, that&#8217;s why tamers tried to tame those who held powerful combat abilities.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Yes, but she never participated in a battle. When she went to help an old weaver, the woman was so satisfied with her skills that asked her to keep working in her shop.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“That&#8217;s great.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Lety couldn’t help but nod at his words.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Yeah, it&#8217;s said that even the other wavers were really impressed by her skills, and she&#8217;s currently recreating patterns, clothes and embroidery techniques from different countries. I’m not an expert in that field, though.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“That&#8217;s amazing!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">She was so enthusiastic that she started to yank him.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>She&#8217;s psyched. Do girls like this kind of stuff?</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Why don&#8217;t we ask her for a sample?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Really?!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Since she was so happy, Raiz thought that letting her see how hard his monsters were working would improve her mood even more.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“C&#8217;mon, let&#8217;s see what my other subordinates are doing.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Sure!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">◆</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">After they finished checking how everyone was doing, Lety&#8217;s fiery nature quelled.<br />\nWhile they were walking, she tried to start a conversation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Seems like they&#8217;re having fun.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Yeah, and the citizens are not that scared by them anymore.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I couldn&#8217;t contain myself when I saw Unicorn so popular with grannies.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Witnessing his despair when surrounded by old women, she couldn&#8217;t suppress her laughter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“They all looked so happy&#8230;”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Whispered her while wearing a complex expression and bringing a hand to her chest.<br />\nShe was ordered to bring him back for the country&#8217;s sake.<br />\nShe knew that was the right thing to do.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>But they&#8217;re happy here, and so are the citizens&#8230;</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">She was astonished by that.<br />\nShe only saw monsters on the battlefield, where they were merciless beasts.<br />\nLords of the sky, destroyers of the earth, rulers of the water.<br />\nThey showed their destructive power to allies and foes alike.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">She couldn&#8217;t believe that they could spend time so peacefully with normal citizens.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>I thought fighting was the only things they could do&#8230; but Raiz&#8217;s monsters are different. What am I here for, then? To bring them back to the battlefield and steal their smile?</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">A choice laid before her: listen to her heart and make Raiz rejoin the army, or leave and let those monsters live peacefully.<br />\nShe didn&#8217;t know what to do.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Hey, are you hungry? Wanna grab a bite?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Eh?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">His sudden question brought her back to reality.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Since you came this far, you should taste something you can eat only here!”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">She would have remembered that meal forever.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter17/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/monstersguild/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter19/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" >\n<div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1491\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"208c6121db\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1491\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">4+</span>\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n","title":"Monsters&#8217; Guild &#8211; Chapter 18","featured_media":{"id":"0d92c2f4-93f0-5f5c-96b4-1f4f6b5bd939","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/monsters-guild-banner-1.png"},"categories":[{"id":"30e10852-d86d-5f1d-b35d-f45bf02d53e9","name":"Welcome to the Monsters Guild!"}],"excerpt":"<p>Raiz&#8217;s job &#8211; The town “Hello~!
