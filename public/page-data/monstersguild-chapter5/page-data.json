It’s my turn to wake up Lord Raiz!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Green vines smacked the harpy’s wings.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Ouch!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Rising her perfect eyebrows, she turned her head to see who hit her.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Dryad, that hurt!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">In front of her stood a beautiful girl wearing a skirt that was red like roses.<br />\nOr rather, more than “red like roses,” it was actually made of roses.<br />\nThe girl was a dryad, a plant spirit, and also another subordinate of Raiz.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“So what? You will forget about it as soon as you take three steps, anyway.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“That’s not true, it’s just a legend! It’s not like all bird monsters have bird brains, you know!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Bird monsters aren’t really smart, but neither they are stupid as widely believed, even though they aren’t anything special.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Oh, really? Anyway, I think you should get away from there.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Eh?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The instant later…</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\"><em>Whack!</em></p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The door suddenly opened and hit Harpy, blowing her away.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“See? I warned you.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Of course, Dryad did that.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As she kept Harpy busy, she made ivy descend from her skirt and made it get around Harpy to reach the door.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Uhuh, I won for today. Masteeer~ rise and sh…”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Hey, good morning.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Hearing his voice, Dryad froze in the doorway.<br />\nIt wasn’t because she couldn’t wake him up herself…<br />\nBut because Lamia was lying beside him.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Oh, c’mon! Why are you even here if you can’t stand the morning’s cold?!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Becauth I thtayed up late latht night. Had thtuff to do, but had thome problems, tho I waited outhide the door all night.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As she yawned, she replied triumphant without controlling her lisp.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I can’t believe you came up with such a plan! You can’t have understood my weak point!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Eheh~”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Lamia’s usual grace was nowhere to be found.<br />\nSleepiness can change people.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“I swear that tonight I’ll lock the door from the inside with my ivy. You’ll see!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">As the dryad thought of a plan to win her next battle, Harpy swooped down on her and assaulted the spirit with a powerful kick.<br />\nHer legs were also like a bird’s… claws included.<br />\nBeing hit like that would have easily carved a deep gash in any common creature’s flesh.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Have you lost your mind?! If I didn’t guard against that I would be disfigured now! Good heavens, learn some basic decency!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The dryad whined angrily.<br />\nThat was indeed a close call.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Were you any better before?!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“At least I do that every time!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">The two started to quarrel.<br />\nYes, those sweet monsters always tried to steal each other’s turn to wake up their boss.<br />\nMales didn’t want to meddle in that war.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"CENTER\">◆</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“So, today too I’ll count on you. Lamia, for taking people on roofs, and Unicorn, for the usual…”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“No, I want to heal young girls, please! I don’t mind even being a baby-sitter!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Shrugging off his complaints, Raiz kept reading the daily schedule.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“The others still don’t have anything to do. Well, I can’t even imagine what they could ask to Dragon… Treant, Dryad, you want to help the farmers with their fields, right?”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Yes. When we went to check the conditions of the plants and vegetables, a farmer asked us to help with his field.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Well, I guess that’s fine. But since it’s your first job, I’ll come with you.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Raiz had to be around when he made new monsters interact with humans.<br />\nEven though some of them could talk, who knows what could happen without him being present.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“If you’re ready, let’s go.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Treant, Lord Raiz said we can go!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">Said Dryad while facing the doorway. Outside, a tree moved rustling.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Yes!”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">It said, slowly rising its roots and moving his branches like human arms.<br />\nYes, that wasn’t a common tree, but an arboreal monster. A treant.</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“If anything happens, call me. We will be at the fields.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">“Alright.”</p>\n<p align=\"JUSTIFY\">After making sure that Lamia knew their location, just in case some trouble was to arise, they departed for their destination.</p>\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"JUSTIFY\"><a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter4/\">&lt;Prev</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/projects/monstersguild/\">Index</a> | <a href=\"https://www.acantranslations.com/monstersguild-chapter6/\">Next&gt;</a></p>\n</div><div class=\"fusion-clearfix\"></div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t</div></div></div>\n\t\t<div class=\"wpulike wpulike-default \" ><div class=\"wp_ulike_general_class wp_ulike_is_not_liked\"><button type=\"button\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-id=\"1218\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-nonce=\"41dead33ff\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-type=\"likeThis\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-display-likers=\"1\"\n\t\t\t\t\tdata-ulike-disable-pophover=\"0\"\n\t\t\t\t\tclass=\"wp_ulike_btn wp_ulike_put_image wp_likethis_1218\"></button><span class=\"count-box\">3+</span>\t\t\t</div></div>\n\t","title":"Monsters&#8217; Guild &#8211; Chapter 5","featured_media":{"id":"0d92c2f4-93f0-5f5c-96b4-1f4f6b5bd939","source_url":"https://www.acantranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/monsters-guild-banner-1.png"},"categories":[{"id":"30e10852-d86d-5f1d-b35d-f45bf02d53e9","name":"Welcome to the Monsters Guild!"}],"excerpt":"<p>3+</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"monstersguild-chapter5"}}}
